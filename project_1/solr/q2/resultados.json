        "Name": "Tricuspid regurgitation",
        "Overview": "Tricuspid regurgitation (TR), also called tricuspid insufficiency, is a type of valvular heart disease in which the tricuspid valve of the heart, located between the right atrium and right ventricle, does not close completely when the right ventricle contracts (systole). TR allows the blood to flow backwards from the right ventricle to the right atrium, which increases the volume and pressure of the blood both in the right atrium and the right ventricle, which may increase central venous volume and pressure if the backward flow is sufficiently severe. The causes of TR are divided into hereditary and acquired; and also primary and secondary. Primary TR refers to a defect solely in the tricuspid valve, such as infective endocarditis; secondary TR refers to a defect in the valve as a consequence of some other pathology, such as left ventricular failure or pulmonary hypertension. The mechanism of TR is either a dilatation of the base (annulus) of the valve due to right ventricular dilatation, which results in the three leaflets being too far apart to reach one another; or an abnormality of one or more of the three leaflets.",

        "Name": "Pulmonary regurgitation",
        "Overview": "Pulmonary (or pulmonic) regurgitation (or insufficiency, incompetence) is a condition in which the pulmonary valve is incompetent and allows backflow from the pulmonary artery to the right ventricle of the heart during diastole. While a small amount of backflow may occur ordinarily, it is usually only shown on an echocardiogram and is harmless. More pronounced regurgitation that is noticed through a routine physical examination is a medical sign of disease and warrants further investigation. If it is secondary to pulmonary hypertension it is referred to as a Graham Steell murmur.",

        "Name": "Valvular heart disease",
        "Overview": "Valvular heart disease is any cardiovascular disease process involving one or more of the four valves of the heart (the aortic and mitral valves on the left side of heart and the pulmonic and tricuspid valves on the right side of heart). These conditions occur largely as a consequence of aging, but may also be the result of congenital (inborn) abnormalities or specific disease or physiologic processes including rheumatic heart disease and pregnancy. Anatomically, the valves are part of the dense connective tissue of the heart known as the cardiac skeleton and are responsible for the regulation of blood flow through the heart and great vessels. Valve failure or dysfunction can result in diminished heart functionality, though the particular consequences are dependent on the type and severity of valvular disease. Treatment of damaged valves may involve medication alone, but often involves surgical valve repair or valve replacement.",

        "Name": "Hypoplastic left heart syndrome",
        "Overview": "Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a rare congenital heart defect in which the left side of the heart is severely underdeveloped and incapable of supporting the systemic circulation. It is estimated to account for 2-3% of all congenital heart disease. Early signs and symptoms include poor feeding, cyanosis, and diminished pulse in the extremities. The etiology is believed to be multifactorial resulting from a combination of genetic mutations and defects resulting in altered blood flow in the heart. Several structures can be affected including the left ventricle, aorta, aortic valve, or mitral valve all resulting in decreased systemic blood flow. Diagnosis can occur prenatally via ultrasound or shortly after birth via echocardiography. Initial management is geared to maintaining patency of the ductus arteriosus - a connection between the pulmonary artery and the aorta that closes shortly after birth. Thereafter, a patient subsequently undergoes a three-stage palliative repair over the next few years of life. The Norwood procedure is typically done within a few days of birth. The Glenn procedure is typically performed at three to six months of age. Finally the Fontan procedure is done sometime between the age of two and five years of age. If left untreated, patients with HLHS die within the first weeks of life while 70% of those that undergo three-staged palliative surgery reach adulthood. After surgery, children with HLHS typically experience neurodevelopmental as well as motor delay and are at an increased risk of heart failure as adults.",

        "Overview": "Mitral regurgitation (MR), also known as mitral insufficiency or mitral incompetence, is a form of valvular heart disease in which the mitral valve is insufficient and does not close properly when the heart pumps out blood. It is the abnormal leaking of blood backwards - regurgitation from the left ventricle, through the mitral valve, into the left atrium, when the left ventricle contracts. Mitral regurgitation is the most common form of valvular heart disease.",

        "Name": "Aortic stenosis",
        "Overview": "Aortic stenosis (AS or AoS) is the narrowing of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins), such that problems result. It may occur at the aortic valve as well as above and below this level. It typically gets worse over time. Symptoms often come on gradually with a decreased ability to exercise often occurring first. If heart failure, loss of consciousness, or heart related chest pain occur due to AS the outcomes are worse. Loss of consciousness typically occurs with standing or exercising. Signs of heart failure include shortness of breath especially when lying down, at night, or with exercise, and swelling of the legs. Thickening of the valve without causing obstruction is known as aortic sclerosis. Causes include being born with a bicuspid aortic valve, and rheumatic fever; a normal valve may also harden over the decades due to calcification. A bicuspid aortic valve affects about one to two percent of the population. As of 2014 rheumatic heart disease mostly occurs in the developing world. Risk factors are similar to those of coronary artery disease and include smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and being male. The aortic valve usually has three leaflets and is located between the left ventricle of the heart, and the aorta. AS typically results in a heart murmur. Its severity can be divided into mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, distinguishable by ultrasound scan of the heart. Aortic stenosis is typically followed using repeated ultrasound scans. Once it has become severe, treatment primarily involves valve replacement surgery, with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) being an option in some who are at high risk from surgery. Valves may either be mechanical or bioprosthetic, with each having risks and benefits. Another less invasive procedure, balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV), may result in benefit, but for only a few months. Complications such as heart failure may be treated in the same way as in those with mild to moderate AS. In those with severe disease a number of medications should be avoided, including ACE inhibitors, nitroglycerin, and some beta blockers. Nitroprusside or phenylephrine may be used in those with decompensated heart failure depending on the blood pressure. Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease in the developed world. It affects about 2% of people who are over 65 years of age. Estimated rates were not known in most of the developing world as of 2014. In those who have symptoms, without repair the chance of death at five years is about 50% and at 10 years is about 90%. Aortic stenosis was first described by French physician Lazare Rivière in 1663.",

        "Name": "Tricuspid atresia",
        "Overview": "Tricuspid atresia is a form of congenital heart disease whereby there is a complete absence of the tricuspid valve. Therefore, there is an absence of right atrioventricular connection. This leads to a hypoplastic (undersized) or absent right ventricle. This defect occurs during prenatal development, when the heart does not finish developing. It causes the systemic circulation to be filled with relatively deoxygenated blood. The causes of tricuspid atresia are unknown. In most cases of tricuspid atresia, additional defects exist to allow exchange of blood between the loops of systematic circulation and pulmonary circulation, filling in the role of the missing atrioventricular connection. An atrial septal defect (ASD) must be present to fill the left atrium and the left ventricle with blood. Since there is a lack of connection to the right ventricle, there must also be a way to pump blood into the pulmonary artery. This can be accomplished by a ventricular septal defect (VSD) connecting the left ventricle to the pulmonary artery or by a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) connecting the aorta to the pulmonary artery. In the latter case, prostaglandin E1 is used to maintain the PDA connection until emergency corrective surgery can be completed. As oxygenated blood is mixed with deoxygenated blood in both cases, there is a reduction in the oxygen-carrying capacity. It is also possible for tricuspid atresia to appear without the life-saving defects. In this case, the systemic and pulmonary circulations would be cut off from each other and no useful breathing can occur. An experimental procedure called fetal balloon atrial septostomy can be used to artificially create the required defect in utero.",

        "Name": "Ventricular septal defect",
        "Overview": "A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a defect in the ventricular septum, the wall dividing the left and right ventricles of the heart. The extent of the opening may vary from pin size to complete absence of the ventricular septum, creating one common ventricle. The ventricular septum consists of an inferior muscular and superior membranous portion and is extensively innervated with conducting cardiomyocytes. The membranous portion, which is close to the atrioventricular node, is most commonly affected in adults and older children in the United States. It is also the type that will most commonly require surgical intervention, comprising over 80% of cases. Membranous ventricular septal defects are more common than muscular ventricular septal defects, and are the most common congenital cardiac anomaly.",

        "Name": "Pulmonary valve stenosis",
        "Overview": "Pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS) is a heart valve disorder. Blood going from the heart to the lungs goes through the pulmonary valve, whose purpose is to prevent blood from flowing back to the heart. In pulmonary valve stenosis this opening is too narrow, leading to a reduction of flow of blood to the lungs. While the most common cause of pulmonary valve stenosis is congenital heart disease, it may also be due to a malignant carcinoid tumor. Both stenosis of the pulmonary artery and pulmonary valve stenosis are forms of pulmonic stenosis (nonvalvular and valvular, respectively) but pulmonary valve stenosis accounts for 80% of pulmonic stenosis. PVS was the key finding that led Jacqueline Noonan to identify the syndrome now called Noonan syndrome.",

        "Name": "Pulmonary artery stenosis",
        "Overview": "Pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS) is a narrowing of the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery is a blood vessel moving blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs. This narrowing can be due to many causes, including infection during pregnancy, a congenital heart defect, a problem with blood clotting in childhood or early adulthood, or a genetic change. The narrowing can occur at many points along the pulmonary artery. The specific location indicates severity and affects treatment options. Most people with high-risk PAS are neonates, newborns, and young children. The more severe the disease the more likely it is to present with symptoms. With high-risk patients, it is necessary and acceptable to actively treat, to avoid worsening blood pressure, poor heart function, and worsening vessel disease across the body. Blood flows in a methodical way through the body. Blood that has already delivered oxygen returns to the heart. It arrives at the right upper chamber, gets pumped though the tricuspid valve and into the lower right chamber. It travels through the pulmonary valve to the pulmonary artery and toward the lungs. Oxygenated blood returns to the left side of the heart before it is pumped throughout the body. When the pulmonary artery narrows, it increases blood pressure on the right side of the heart and causes the heart to work harder. PAS is not the same as pulmonary valve stenosis. The pulmonary valve is the opening between the right heart and the pulmonary artery. Valve narrowing has similar effects. However, treatment is different. The long term consequences of each condition also vary and present with other comorbidities.",

        "Overview": "Atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) or atrioventricular canal defect (AVCD), also known as \"common atrioventricular canal\" or \"endocardial cushion defect\" (ECD), is characterized by a deficiency of the atrioventricular septum of the heart that creates connections between all four of its chambers. It is a very specific combination of 3 defects: 1) Atrial Septal Defect (ASD), a hole in the wall between the right and left atria; 2) Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD), a hole in the wall between the right and left ventricles; and 3) Abnormalities of the mitral and/or tricuspid valves. AVCD is caused by an abnormal or inadequate fusion of the superior and inferior endocardial cushions with the mid portion of the atrial septum and the muscular portion of the ventricular septum. Unlike some heart defects, the condition will not resolve over time and most infants must undergo open heart surgery. The surgery to correct this defect is usually successful and most babies do very well post-op.",

        "Overview": "Pulmonary vein stenosis is a rare cardiovascular disorder. It is recognized as being the stenosis of one or more of the four pulmonary veins that return blood from the lungs to the left atrium of the heart. In congenital cases, it is associated with poor prognosis and high mortality rate. In some people, pulmonary vein stenosis occurs after pulmonary vein ablation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Some recent research has indicated that it may be genetically linked in congenital cases.",

        "Name": "Absent pulmonary valve syndrome",
        "Overview": "Absent pulmonary valve syndrome (APVS) is a congenital heart defect that occurs when the flaps of the pulmonary valve do not develop or are severely underdeveloped (hypoplasia) resulting in aneurysms (dilation) of the pulmonary arteries and softening of the trachea and bronchi (tracheobronchomalacia). Usually, APVS occurs together with other congenital heart defects, most commonly ventricular septal defect and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. It is sometimes considered a variant of Tetralogy of Fallot. The first case of absent pulmonary valve syndrome was reported Crampton in 1830.",

        "Overview": "Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a congenital condition whereby the aorta is narrow, usually in the area where the ductus arteriosus (ligamentum arteriosum after regression) inserts. The word coarctation means \"pressing or drawing together; narrowing\". Coarctations are most common in the aortic arch. The arch may be small in babies with coarctations. Other heart defects may also occur when coarctation is present, typically occurring on the left side of the heart. When a patient has a coarctation, the left ventricle has to work harder. Since the aorta is narrowed, the left ventricle must generate a much higher pressure than normal in order to force enough blood through the aorta to deliver blood to the lower part of the body. If the narrowing is severe enough, the left ventricle may not be strong enough to push blood through the coarctation, thus resulting in a lack of blood to the lower half of the body. Physiologically its complete form is manifested as interrupted aortic arch.",

The single functional ventricle could be morphologically right or left with the second ventricle usually hypoplastic and/or insufficiently functional. Therefore, there are several subtypes of the disease, depending on which ventricle is underdeveloped. Single ventricle with functional left ventricle: Pulmonal atresia Tricuspidal atresia Double inlet left ventricle Double outlet left ventricle Single ventricle with functional right ventricle: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome Double inlet right ventricle Double outlet right ventricle Single ventricle heterotaxy syndrome is also included to this category.",

        "Name": "Tetralogy of Fallot",
        "Overview": "Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), formerly known as Steno-Fallot tetralogy, is a congenital heart defect characterized by four specific cardiac defects. Classically, the four defects are: pulmonary stenosis, which is narrowing of the exit from the right ventricle; a ventricular septal defect, which is a hole allowing blood to flow between the two ventricles; right ventricular hypertrophy, which is thickening of the right ventricular muscle; and an overriding aorta, which is where the aorta expands to allow blood from both ventricles to enter. At birth, children may be asymptomatic or present with many severe symptoms. Later in infancy, there are typically episodes of bluish colour to the skin due to a lack of sufficient oxygenation, known as cyanosis. When affected babies cry or have a bowel movement, they may undergo a \"tet spell\" where they turn cyanotic, have difficulty breathing, become limp, and occasionally lose consciousness. Other symptoms may include a heart murmur, finger clubbing, and easy tiring upon breastfeeding. The cause of tetralogy of Fallot is typically not known. Risk factors include a mother who uses alcohol, has diabetes, is over the age of 40, or gets rubella during pregnancy. It may also be associated with Down syndrome and other chromosomal defects that cause congenital heart defects. TOF is typically treated by open heart surgery in the first year of life. The timing of surgery depends on the baby's symptoms and size. The procedure involves increasing the size of the pulmonary valve and pulmonary arteries and repairing the ventricular septal defect. In babies who are too small, a temporary surgery may be done with plans for a second surgery when the baby is bigger. With proper care, most people who are affected live to be adults. Long-term problems may include an irregular heart rate and pulmonary regurgitation. The prevalence of TOF is estimated to be anywhere from 0.02 to 0.04%. Though males and females were initially thought to be affected equally, more recent studies have found males to be affected more than females. It is the most common complex congenital heart defect, accounting for about 10 percent of cases. It was initially described in 1671 by Niels Steensen. A further description was published in 1888 by the French physician Étienne-Louis Arthur Fallot, after whom it is named. The first total surgical repair was carried out in 1954.",

        "Name": "Lutembacher's syndrome",
        "Overview": "Lutembacher's syndrome is a very rare form of congenital heart disease that affects one of the chambers of the heart (commonly the atria) as well as a valve (commonly the mitral valve). It is commonly known as both congenital atrial septal defect (ASD) and acquired mitral stenosis (MS). Congenital (at birth) atrial septal defect refers to a hole being in the septum or wall that separates the two atria; this condition is usually seen in fetuses and infants. Mitral stenosis refers to mitral valve leaflets (or valve flaps) sticking to each other making the opening for blood to pass from the atrium to the ventricles very small. With the valve being so small, blood has difficulty passing from the left atrium into the left ventricle. Septal defects that may occur with Lutembacher's syndrome include: Ostium primum atrial septal defect or ostium secundum which is more prevalent. Lutembacher's syndrome affects females more often than males. It can affect children or adults; the person can either be born with the disorder or develop it later in life. The syndrome was first described by René Lutembacher (1884-1968) of Paris in 1916. To correct Lutembacher's syndrome, surgery is often done. There are several types of surgeries depending on the cause of Lutembacher's syndrome (ASD Primum or ASD Ostium Secundum with Mitral Stenosis): Suturing (stitching) or placing a patch of tissue (similar to skin grafting) over the hole to completely close the opening Reconstructing of the mitral and tricuspid valve while patching any holes in the heart Device closure of ASD (e.g. Amplatzer umbrella or CardioSEAL to seal the hole) Percutaneous transcatheter therapy Transcatheter therapy of balloon valvuloplasty to correct MS",
