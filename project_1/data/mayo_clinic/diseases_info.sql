                'Abdominal aortic aneurysm', 
                'An abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs when a lower part of the body''s main artery, called the aorta, becomes weakened and bulges.', 
                'Abdominal aortic aneurysms often grow slowly without noticeable symptoms. This makes them difficult to detect. Some aneurysms never rupture. Many start small and stay small. Others grow larger over time, sometimes quickly. If you have a growing abdominal aortic aneurysm, you might notice: Deep, constant pain in the belly area or side of the belly. Back pain. A pulse near the bellybutton. If you have pain, especially if pain is sudden and severe, seek medical help right away.', 
                'Aneurysms can develop anywhere along the aorta. Most aortic aneurysms occur in the part of the aorta that''s in the belly area, called the abdomen. Several things can lead to the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, including: Hardening of the arteries, called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis occurs when fat and other substances build up on the lining of a blood vessel. High blood pressure. High blood pressure can damage and weaken the aorta''s walls. Blood vessel diseases. These are diseases that cause blood vessels to become inflamed. Infection in the aorta. Rarely, infection by certain bacteria or fungi might cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Trauma. For example, being injured in a car accident can cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm.', 
                'Abdominal aortic aneurysm risk factors include: Tobacco use. Smoking is the strongest risk factor for aortic aneurysms. Smoking can weaken the walls of blood vessels, including the aorta. This raises the risk of aortic aneurysm and aneurysm rupture. The longer and more you use tobacco, the greater the chances are of developing an aortic aneurysm. Men ages 65 to 75 who are current or former smokers should have a one-time ultrasound to screen for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Age. Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur most often in people age 65 and older. Being male. Men develop abdominal aortic aneurysms much more often than women do. Being white. People who are white are at higher risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Family history. Having a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms increases the risk of having the condition. Other aneurysms. Having an aneurysm in the aorta in the chest (thoracic aortic aneurysm) or in another large blood vessel, such as the artery behind the knee, might increase the risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. If you''re at risk of an aortic aneurysm, medicines may be given to lower your blood pressure and relieve stress on weakened arteries.', 
                'Complications of abdominal aortic aneurysms include: Tears in one or more of the layers of the wall of the aorta, called an aortic dissection. Rupture of the aneurysm. A rupture can cause life-threatening internal bleeding. In general, the larger the aneurysm and the faster it grows, the greater the risk of rupture. Symptoms that an aortic aneurysm has ruptured can include: Sudden, intense and persistent belly or back pain, which may feel like ripping or tearing. Low blood pressure. Fast pulse. Aortic aneurysms also increase the risk of developing blood clots in the area. If a blood clot breaks loose from the inside wall of an aneurysm, it can block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body. Symptoms of a blocked blood vessel may include pain or reduced blood flow to the legs, toes, kidneys or belly area.', 
                'To prevent an abdominal aortic aneurysm or to keep one from worsening, do the following: Don''t smoke or use tobacco products. If you smoke or chew tobacco, quit. Also avoid secondhand smoke. If you need help quitting, talk to your health care provider about strategies that may help. Eat a healthy diet. Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, chicken, fish, and low-fat dairy products. Avoid saturated and trans fats and limit salt. Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol under control. If your care provider prescribed medicines, take them as instructed. Get regular exercise. Try to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity. If you haven''t been active, start slowly and build up. Talk to your health care provider about what kinds of activities are right for you.'

                'Absence seizure', 
                'Absence seizures involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness. They''re more common in children than in adults. A person having an absence seizure may stare blankly into space for a few seconds. Then the person typically returns quickly to being alert. This type of seizure usually doesn''t lead to physical injury. But injury can result during the period when the person loses consciousness. This is particularly true if someone is driving a car or riding a bike when the seizure happens. Absence seizures usually can be controlled with anti-seizure medicines. Some children who have them also develop other seizures, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures or myoclonic seizures. Many children outgrow absence seizures in their teens.', 
                'A simple absence seizure causes a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a brief lapse in attention. The seizure lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 30 seconds. There''s no confusion, headache or drowsiness after the seizure. Symptoms of absence seizures include: A sudden stop in activity without falling. Lip smacking. Eyelid flutters. Chewing motions. Finger rubbing. Small movements of both hands. Afterward, there''s usually no memory of the incident. But if the seizure is longer, the person may be aware of missed time. Some people have many episodes daily. When it happens, it can interfere with school or daily activities. A child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices them. This is because the seizures are so brief. A decline in a child''s learning ability may be the first sign of the seizure disorder. Teachers may say the child has trouble paying attention or that a child is often daydreaming. Contact your child''s pediatrician: If you''re concerned that your child may be having seizures. If your child has epilepsy but develops symptoms of a new type of seizure. If the seizures continue to occur despite taking anti-seizure medicine. Contact 911 or emergency services in your area: If you observe prolonged automatic behaviors lasting minutes to hours. This may include activities such as eating or moving without awareness. It also might include prolonged confusion. These are possible symptoms of a condition called status epilepticus. After any seizure lasting more than five minutes.', 
                'Absence seizures usually have a genetic cause. In general, seizures occur as a result of a burst of electrical impulses from nerve cells in the brain, called neurons. Neurons typically send electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect them. In people who have seizures, the brain''s usual electrical activity is altered. During an absence seizure, these electrical signals repeat themselves over and over in a three-second pattern. People who have seizures also may have altered levels of the chemical messengers that help the nerve cells communicate with one another. These chemical messengers are called neurotransmitters.', 
                'Certain factors are common to children who have absence seizures, including: Age. Absence seizures are more common in children between the ages of 4 and 14. Sex. Absence seizures are more common in females. Family members who have seizures. Nearly a quarter of children with absence seizures have a close relative who has seizures.', 
                'While most children outgrow absence seizures, some: Must take anti-seizure medicines throughout life. Eventually have full convulsions, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Other complications can include: Learning problems. Behavior problems. Social isolation. Injury during the seizure.',

Acanthosis nigricans (ak-an-THOE-sis NIE-grih-kuns) tends to affect people with obesity. Rarely, the skin condition can be a sign of cancer in an internal organ, such as the stomach or liver. Treating the cause of acanthosis nigricans might restore the usual color and texture of the skin.',

                'Acanthosis nigricans might be related to: Insulin resistance. Most people who have acanthosis nigricans have also become resistant to insulin. Insulin is a hormone secreted by the pancreas that allows the body to process sugar. Insulin resistance is what leads to type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance is also related to polycystic ovarian syndrome and might be a factor in why acanthosis nigricans develops. Certain drugs and supplements. High-dose niacin, birth control pills, prednisone and other corticosteroids may cause acanthosis nigricans. Cancer. Some types of cancer cause acanthosis nigricans. These include lymphoma and cancers of the stomach, colon and liver.',

                'Achalasia', 
                'Achalasia is a swallowing condition that affects the tube connecting the mouth and the stomach, called the esophagus. Damaged nerves make it hard for the muscles of the esophagus to squeeze food and liquid into the stomach. Food then collects in the esophagus, sometimes fermenting and washing back up into the mouth. This fermented food can taste bitter. Achalasia is a fairly rare condition. Some people mistake it for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, in achalasia, the food is coming from the esophagus. In GERD, the material comes from the stomach. There''s no cure for achalasia. Once the esophagus is damaged, the muscles cannot work properly again. But symptoms can usually be managed with endoscopy, minimally invasive therapy or surgery.', 
                'Achalasia symptoms generally appear gradually and get worse over time. Symptoms may include: Difficulty swallowing, called dysphagia, which may feel like food or drink is stuck in the throat. Swallowed food or saliva flowing back into the throat. Heartburn. Belching. Chest pain that comes and goes. Coughing at night. Pneumonia from getting food in the lungs. Weight loss. Vomiting.', 
                'The exact cause of achalasia is poorly understood. Researchers suspect that it may be caused by a loss of nerve cells in the esophagus. There are theories about what causes this, but viral infection or autoimmune responses are possibilities. Very rarely, achalasia may be caused by an inherited genetic disorder or infection.', 
                'Risk factors for achalasia include: Age. Although achalasia can affect people of all ages, it''s more common in people between 25 and 60 years of age. Certain medical conditions. The risk of achalasia is higher in people with allergic disorders, adrenal insufficiency or Allgrove syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic condition.',

                'Achilles tendinitis', 
                'Achilles tendinitis is an overuse injury of the Achilles (uh-KILL-eez) tendon, the band of tissue that connects calf muscles at the back of the lower leg to your heel bone. Achilles tendinitis most commonly occurs in runners who have suddenly increased the intensity or duration of their runs. It''s also common in middle-aged people who play sports, such as tennis or basketball, only on the weekends. Most cases of Achilles tendinitis can be treated with relatively simple, at-home care under your doctor''s supervision. Self-care strategies are usually necessary to prevent recurring episodes. More-serious cases of Achilles tendinitis can lead to tendon tears (ruptures) that may require surgical repair.', 
                'The pain associated with Achilles tendinitis typically begins as a mild ache in the back of the leg or above the heel after running or other sports activity. Episodes of more-severe pain may occur after prolonged running, stair climbing or sprinting. You might also experience tenderness or stiffness, especially in the morning, which usually improves with mild activity.', 
                'Achilles tendinitis is caused by repetitive or intense strain on the Achilles tendon, the band of tissue that connects your calf muscles to your heel bone. This tendon is used when you walk, run, jump or push up on your toes. The structure of the Achilles tendon weakens with age, which can make it more susceptible to injury — particularly in people who may participate in sports only on the weekends or who have suddenly increased the intensity of their running programs.', 
                'A number of factors may increase your risk of Achilles tendinitis, including: Your sex. Achilles tendinitis occurs most commonly in men. Age. Achilles tendinitis is more common as you age. Physical problems. A naturally flat arch in your foot can put more strain on the Achilles tendon. Obesity and tight calf muscles also can increase tendon strain. Training choices. Running in worn-out shoes can increase your risk of Achilles tendinitis. Tendon pain occurs more frequently in cold weather than in warm weather, and running on hilly terrain also can predispose you to Achilles injury. Medical conditions. People who have psoriasis or high blood pressure are at higher risk of developing Achilles tendinitis. Medications. Certain types of antibiotics, called fluoroquinolones, have been associated with higher rates of Achilles tendinitis.', 
                'Achilles tendinitis can weaken the tendon, making it more vulnerable to a tear (rupture) — a painful injury that usually requires surgical repair.', 
                'While it may not be possible to prevent Achilles tendinitis, you can take measures to reduce your risk: Increase your activity level gradually. If you''re just beginning an exercise regimen, start slowly and gradually increase the duration and intensity of the training. Take it easy. Avoid activities that place excessive stress on your tendons, such as hill running. If you participate in a strenuous activity, warm up first by exercising at a slower pace. If you notice pain during a particular exercise, stop and rest. Choose your shoes carefully. The shoes you wear while exercising should provide adequate cushioning for your heel and should have a firm arch support to help reduce the tension in the Achilles tendon. Replace your worn-out shoes. If your shoes are in good condition but don''t support your feet, try arch supports in both shoes. Stretch daily. Take the time to stretch your calf muscles and Achilles tendon in the morning, before exercise and after exercise to maintain flexibility. This is especially important to avoid a recurrence of Achilles tendinitis. Strengthen your calf muscles. Strong calf muscles enable the calf and Achilles tendon to better handle the stresses they encounter with activity and exercise. Cross-train. Alternate high-impact activities, such as running and jumping, with low-impact activities, such as cycling and swimming.'

                'Although it''s possible to have no signs or symptoms with an Achilles tendon rupture, most people have: The feeling of having been kicked in the calf Pain, possibly severe, and swelling near the heel An inability to bend the foot downward or "push off" the injured leg when walking An inability to stand on the toes on the injured leg A popping or snapping sound when the injury occurs Seek medical advice immediately if you hear a pop in your heel, especially if you can''t walk properly afterward.', 
                'Your Achilles tendon helps you point your foot downward, rise on your toes and push off your foot as you walk. You rely on it virtually every time you walk and move your foot. Rupture usually occurs in the section of the tendon situated within 2 1/2 inches (about 6 centimeters) of the point where it attaches to the heel bone. This section might be prone to rupture because blood flow is poor, which also can impair its ability to heal. Ruptures often are caused by a sudden increase in the stress on your Achilles tendon. Common examples include: Increasing the intensity of sports participation, especially in sports that involve jumping Falling from a height Stepping into a hole', 
                'Factors that may increase your risk of Achilles tendon rupture include: Age. The peak age for Achilles tendon rupture is 30 to 40. Sex. Achilles tendon rupture is up to five times more likely to occur in men than in women. Recreational sports. Achilles tendon injuries occur more often during sports that involve running, jumping, and sudden starts and stops — such as soccer, basketball and tennis. Steroid injections. Doctors sometimes inject steroids into an ankle joint to reduce pain and inflammation. However, this medication can weaken nearby tendons and has been associated with Achilles tendon ruptures. Certain antibiotics. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro) or levofloxacin (Levaquin), increase the risk of Achilles tendon rupture. Obesity. Excess weight puts more strain on the tendon.', 
                NULL, 
                'To reduce your chance of developing Achilles tendon problems, follow these tips: Stretch and strengthen calf muscles. Stretch your calf until you feel a noticeable pull but not pain. Don''t bounce during a stretch. Calf-strengthening exercises can also help the muscle and tendon absorb more force and prevent injury. Vary your exercises. Alternate high-impact sports, such as running, with low-impact sports, such as walking, biking or swimming. Avoid activities that place excessive stress on your Achilles tendons, such as hill running and jumping activities. Choose running surfaces carefully. Avoid or limit running on hard or slippery surfaces. Dress properly for cold-weather training, and wear well-fitting athletic shoes with proper cushioning in the heels. Increase training intensity slowly. Achilles tendon injuries commonly occur after an abrupt increase in training intensity. Increase the distance, duration and frequency of your training by no more than 10 percent weekly.'

                'The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the key ligaments that help stabilize the knee joint. The ACL connects the thighbone (femur) to the shinbone (tibia). It''s most commonly torn during sports that involve sudden stops and changes in direction — such as basketball, soccer, tennis and volleyball.', 
                'Signs and symptoms of an ACL injury usually include: A loud pop or a "popping" sensation in the knee Severe pain and inability to continue activity Rapid swelling Loss of range of motion A feeling of instability or "giving way" with weight bearing Seek immediate care if any injury to your knee causes signs or symptoms of an ACL injury. The knee joint is a complex structure of bones, ligaments, tendons and other tissues that work together. It''s important to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis to determine the severity of the injury and get proper treatment.', 
                'Ligaments are strong bands of tissue that connect one bone to another. The ACL, one of two ligaments that cross in the middle of the knee, connects your thighbone to your shinbone and helps stabilize your knee joint. ACL injuries often happen during sports and fitness activities that can put stress on the knee: Suddenly slowing down and changing direction (cutting) Pivoting with your foot firmly planted Landing awkwardly from a jump Stopping suddenly Receiving a direct blow to the knee or having a collision, such as a football tackle When the ligament is damaged, there is usually a partial or complete tear of the tissue. A mild injury may stretch the ligament but leave it intact.', 
                'There are a number of factors that increase your risk of an ACL injury, including: Being female — possibly due to differences in anatomy, muscle strength and hormonal influences Participating in certain sports, such as soccer, football, basketball, gymnastics and downhill skiing Poor conditioning Using faulty movement patterns, such as moving the knees inward during a squat Wearing footwear that doesn''t fit properly Using poorly maintained sports equipment, such as ski bindings that aren''t adjusted properly Playing on artificial turf', 
                'People who experience an ACL injury have a higher risk of developing osteoarthritis in the knee. Arthritis may occur even if you have surgery to reconstruct the ligament. Multiple factors likely influence the risk of arthritis, such as the severity of the original injury, the presence of related injuries in the knee joint or the level of activity after treatment.', 
                'Proper training and exercise can help reduce the risk of ACL injury. A sports medicine physician, physical therapist, athletic trainer or other specialist in sports medicine can provide assessment, instruction and feedback that can help you reduce risks. Programs to reduce ACL injury include: Exercises to strengthen the core — including the hips, pelvis and lower abdomen — with a goal of training athletes to avoid moving the knee inward during a squat Exercises that strengthen leg muscles, particularly hamstring exercises, to ensure an overall balance in leg muscle strength Training and exercise emphasizing proper technique and knee position when jumping and landing from jumps Training to improve technique when performing pivoting and cutting movements Training to strengthen muscles of the legs, hips and core — as well as training to improve jumping and landing techniques and to prevent inward movement of the knee — may help to reduce the higher ACL injury risk in female athletes. Wear footwear and padding that is appropriate for your sport to help prevent injury. If you downhill ski, make sure your ski bindings are adjusted correctly by a trained professional so that your skis will release appropriately if you fall. Wearing a knee brace doesn''t appear to prevent ACL injury or reduce the risk of recurring injury after surgery.'

                'Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages. Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. The pimples and bumps heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up. Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems.', 
                'Acne signs vary depending on the severity of your condition: Whiteheads (closed plugged pores) Blackheads (open plugged pores) Small red, tender bumps (papules) Pimples (pustules), which are papules with pus at their tips  Large, solid, painful lumps under the skin (nodules) Painful, pus-filled lumps under the skin (cystic lesions) Acne usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders. If self-care remedies don''t clear your acne, see your primary care doctor. He or she can prescribe stronger medications. If acne persists or is severe, you may want to seek medical treatment from a doctor who specializes in the skin (dermatologist or pediatric dermatologist). For many women, acne can persist for decades, with flares common a week before menstruation. This type of acne tends to clear up without treatment in women who use contraceptives. In older adults, a sudden onset of severe acne may signal an underlying disease requiring medical attention. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that some popular nonprescription acne lotions, cleansers and other skin products can cause a serious reaction. This type of reaction is quite rare, so don''t confuse it with any redness, irritation or itchiness that occurs in areas where you''ve applied medications or products. Seek emergency medical help if after using a skin product you experience: Faintness Difficulty breathing Swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue Tightness of the throat', 
                'Four main factors cause acne: Excess oil (sebum) production Hair follicles clogged by oil and dead skin cells Bacteria Inflammation Acne typically appears on your face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders because these areas of skin have the most oil (sebaceous) glands. Hair follicles are connected to oil glands. The follicle wall may bulge and produce a whitehead. Or the plug may be open to the surface and darken, causing a blackhead. A blackhead may look like dirt stuck in pores. But actually the pore is congested with bacteria and oil, which turns brown when it''s exposed to the air. Pimples are raised red spots with a white center that develop when blocked hair follicles become inflamed or infected with bacteria. Blockages and inflammation deep inside hair follicles produce cystlike lumps beneath the surface of your skin. Other pores in your skin, which are the openings of the sweat glands, aren''t usually involved in acne. Certain things may trigger or worsen acne: Hormonal changes. Androgens are hormones that increase in boys and girls during puberty and cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge and make more sebum. Hormone changes during midlife, particularly in women, can lead to breakouts too. Certain medications. Examples include drugs containing corticosteroids, testosterone or lithium. Diet. Studies indicate that consuming certain foods — including carbohydrate-rich foods, such as bread, bagels and chips — may worsen acne. Further study is needed to examine whether people with acne would benefit from following specific dietary restrictions. Stress. Stress doesn''t cause acne, but if you have acne already, stress may make it worse. These factors have little effect on acne: Chocolate and greasy foods. Eating chocolate or greasy food has little to no effect on acne. Hygiene. Acne isn''t caused by dirty skin. In fact, scrubbing the skin too hard or cleansing with harsh soaps or chemicals irritates the skin and can make acne worse. Cosmetics. Cosmetics don''t necessarily worsen acne, especially if you use oil-free makeup that doesn''t clog pores (noncomedogenics) and remove makeup regularly. Nonoily cosmetics don''t interfere with the effectiveness of acne drugs.', 
                'Risk factors for acne include: Age. People of all ages can get acne, but it''s most common in teenagers. Hormonal changes. Such changes are common during puberty or pregnancy. Family history. Genetics plays a role in acne. If both of your parents had acne, you''re likely to develop it too. Greasy or oily substances. You may develop acne where your skin comes into contact with oil or oily lotions and creams. Friction or pressure on your skin. This can be caused by items such as telephones, cellphones, helmets, tight collars and backpacks.', 
                'People with darker skin types are more likely than are people with lighter skin to experience these acne complications: Scars. Pitted skin (acne scars) and thick scars (keloids) can remain long-term after acne has healed. Skin changes. After acne has cleared, the affected skin may be darker (hyperpigmented) or lighter (hypopigmented) than before the condition occurred.',

                'Acoustic neuroma', 
                'An acoustic neuroma is a noncancerous tumor that develops on the main nerve leading from the inner ear to the brain. This nerve is called the vestibular nerve. Branches of the nerve directly affect balance and hearing. Pressure from an acoustic neuroma can cause hearing loss, ringing in the ear and problems with balance. Another name for an acoustic neuroma is vestibular schwannoma. An acoustic neuroma develops from the Schwann cells covering the vestibular nerve. An acoustic neuroma is usually slow-growing. Rarely, it may grow quickly and become large enough to press against the brain and affect vital functions. Treatments for an acoustic neuroma include monitoring, radiation and surgical removal.', 
                'Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are often easy to miss and may take years to develop. Symptoms may occur because of the tumor''s effects on the hearing and balance nerves. The tumor also can put pressure on nearby nerves controlling facial muscles, known as the facial nerve, and sensation, known as the trigeminal nerve. Blood vessels or brain structures also can be affected by an acoustic neuroma. As the tumor grows, it may be more likely to cause more noticeable or worse symptoms. Common symptoms of an acoustic neuroma include: Hearing loss, usually gradually over months to years. In rare cases, hearing loss can be sudden. Hearing loss usually occurs on one side or is worse on one side. Ringing in the affected ear, known as tinnitus. Loss of balance or not feeling steady. Dizziness. Facial numbness and, very rarely, weakness or loss of muscle movement. Rarely, an acoustic neuroma may grow large enough to compress the brainstem and become life-threatening. See a health care professional if you notice hearing loss in one ear, ringing in your ear or balance problems. Early diagnosis of an acoustic neuroma may help keep the tumor from growing large enough to cause complications such as total hearing loss.', 
                'The cause of acoustic neuromas can sometimes be linked to a problem with a gene on chromosome 22. Typically, this gene produces a tumor suppressor protein that helps control the growth of Schwann cells covering the nerves. Experts don''t know what causes this problem with the gene. Often there is no known cause for an acoustic neuroma. This gene change is inherited in people with a rare disorder called neurofibromatosis type 2. People with neurofibromatosis type 2 usually have growth of tumors on the hearing and balance nerves on both sides of the head. These tumors are known as bilateral vestibular schwannomas.', 
                'The only confirmed risk factor for acoustic neuromas is having a parent with the rare genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 2. However, neurofibromatosis type 2 only accounts for about 5% of acoustic neuroma cases. A hallmark characteristic of neurofibromatosis type 2 is noncancerous tumors on the balance nerves on both sides of the head. Tumors also may develop on other nerves. Neurofibromatosis type 2 is known as an autosomal dominant disorder. This means that the gene related to the disorder can be passed to a child by just one parent. Each child of an affected parent has a 50-50 chance of inheriting it.', 
                'An acoustic neuroma may cause permanent complications, including: Hearing loss. Facial numbness and weakness. Balance problems. Ringing in the ear. Large tumors may press on the brainstem, occasionally preventing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid between the brain and spinal cord. Fluid can build up in your head, a condition known as hydrocephalus. This increases the pressure inside the skull.',

                'Acromegaly', 
                'Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that develops when your pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone during adulthood. When you have too much growth hormone, your bones increase in size. In childhood, this leads to increased height and is called gigantism. But in adulthood, a change in height doesn''t occur. Instead, the increase in bone size is limited to the bones of your hands, feet and face, and is called acromegaly. Because acromegaly is uncommon and the physical changes occur slowly over many years, the condition sometimes takes a long time to recognize. Untreated, high levels of growth hormone can affect other parts of the body, in addition to your bones. This can lead to serious — sometimes even life-threatening — health problems. But treatment can reduce your risk of complications and significantly improve your symptoms, including the enlargement of your features.', 
                'A common sign of acromegaly is enlarged hands and feet. For example, you may notice that you aren''t able to put on rings that used to fit, and that your shoe size has progressively increased. Acromegaly may also cause gradual changes in your face''s shape, such as a protruding lower jaw and brow bone, an enlarged nose, thickened lips, and wider spacing between your teeth. Because acromegaly tends to progress slowly, early signs may not be obvious for years. Sometimes, people notice the physical changes only by comparing old photos with newer ones. Overall, acromegaly signs and symptoms tend to vary from one person to another, and may include any of the following: Enlarged hands and feet. Enlarged facial features, including the facial bones, lips, nose and tongue. Coarse, oily, thickened skin. Excessive sweating and body odor. Small outgrowths of skin tissue (skin tags). Fatigue and joint or muscle weakness. Pain and limited joint mobility. A deepened, husky voice due to enlarged vocal cords and sinuses. Severe snoring due to obstruction of the upper airway. Vision problems. Headaches, which may be persistent or severe. Menstrual cycle irregularities in women. Erectile dysfunction in men. Loss of interest in sex. If you have signs and symptoms associated with acromegaly, contact your doctor for an exam. Acromegaly usually develops slowly. Even your family members may not notice the gradual physical changes that occur with this disorder at first. But early diagnosis is important so that you can start getting proper care. Acromegaly can lead to serious health problems if it''s not treated.', 
                'Acromegaly occurs when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone (GH) over a long period of time. The pituitary gland is a small gland at the base of your brain, behind the bridge of your nose. It produces GH and a number of other hormones. GH plays an important role in managing your physical growth. When the pituitary gland releases GH into your bloodstream, it triggers your liver to produce a hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) — sometimes also called insulin-like growth factor-I, or IGF-I. IGF-1 is what causes your bones and other tissues to grow. Too much GH leads to too much IGF-1, which can cause acromegaly signs, symptoms and complications. In adults, a tumor is the most common cause of too much GH production: Pituitary tumors. Most acromegaly cases are caused by a noncancerous (benign) tumor (adenoma) of the pituitary gland. The tumor produces excessive amounts of growth hormone, causing many of the signs and symptoms of acromegaly. Some of the symptoms of acromegaly, such as headaches and impaired vision, are due to the tumor pressing on nearby brain tissues. Nonpituitary tumors. In a few people with acromegaly, tumors in other parts of the body, such as the lungs or pancreas, cause the disorder. Sometimes, these tumors secrete GH. In other cases, the tumors produce a hormone called growth hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH), which signals the pituitary gland to make more GH.', 
                'People who have a rare genetic condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1), have a higher risk of developing acromegaly. In MEN 1, the endocrine glands — usually the parathyroid glands, pancreas and pituitary gland — grow tumors and release extra hormones. Those hormones may trigger acromegaly.', 
                'If left untreated, acromegaly can lead to major health problems. Complications may include: High blood pressure (hypertension). High cholesterol. Heart problems, particularly enlargement of the heart (cardiomyopathy). Osteoarthritis. Type 2 diabetes. Enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter). Precancerous growths (polyps) on the lining of your colon. Sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. Carpal tunnel syndrome. Increased risk of cancerous tumors. Spinal cord compression or fractures. Vision changes or vision loss. Early treatment of acromegaly can prevent these complications from developing or becoming worse. Untreated, acromegaly and its complications can lead to premature death.',

                'Actinic keratosis', 
                'An actinic keratosis (ak-TIN-ik ker-uh-TOE-sis) is a rough, scaly patch on the skin that develops from years of sun exposure. It''s often found on the face, lips, ears, forearms, scalp, neck or back of the hands.', 
                'Actinic keratoses vary in appearance. Symptoms include: Rough, dry or scaly patch of skin, usually less than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in diameter Flat to slightly raised patch or bump on the top layer of skin In some cases, a hard, wartlike surface Color variations, including pink, red or brown Itching, burning, bleeding or crusting New patches or bumps on sun-exposed areas of the head, neck, hands and forearms', 
                'An actinic keratosis is caused by frequent or intense exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun or tanning beds.', 
                'Anyone can develop actinic keratoses. But you''re at increased risk if you: Have red or blond hair and blue or light-colored eyes Have a history of a lot of sun exposure or sunburn Tend to freckle or burn when exposed to sunlight Are older than 40 Live in a sunny place Work outdoors Have a weakened immune system', 
                'If treated early, actinic keratosis can be cleared up or removed. If left untreated, some of these spots might progress to squamous cell carcinoma. This is a type of cancer that usually isn''t life-threatening if detected and treated early.', 
                'Sun safety helps prevent actinic keratoses. Take these steps to protect your skin from the sun: Limit your time in the sun. Especially avoid time in the sun between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. And avoid staying in the sun so long that you get a sunburn or a suntan. Use sunscreen. Before spending time outdoors, apply a broad-spectrum water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30, as the American Academy of Dermatology recommends. Do this even on cloudy days. Use sunscreen on all exposed skin. And use lip balm with sunscreen on your lips. Apply sunscreen at least 15 minutes before going outside and reapply it every two hours — or more often if you''re swimming or sweating. Sunscreen is not recommended for babies under 6 months. Rather, keep them out of the sun if possible. Or protect them with shade, hats, and clothing that covers the arms and legs. Cover up. For extra protection from the sun, wear tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs. Also wear a broad-brimmed hat. This provides more protection than does a baseball cap or golf visor. Avoid tanning beds. The UV exposure from a tanning bed can cause just as much skin damage as a tan from the sun. Check your skin regularly and report changes to your health care provider. Examine your skin regularly, looking for the development of new skin growths or changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp. Examine the tops and undersides of your arms and hands.'
