    "Abdominal aortic aneurysm": {
        "Overview": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs when a lower part of the body's main artery, called the aorta, becomes weakened and bulges.",
        "Symptoms": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms often grow slowly without noticeable symptoms. This makes them difficult to detect. Some aneurysms never rupture. Many start small and stay small. Others grow larger over time, sometimes quickly. If you have a growing abdominal aortic aneurysm, you might notice: Deep, constant pain in the belly area or side of the belly. Back pain. A pulse near the bellybutton. If you have pain, especially if pain is sudden and severe, seek medical help right away.",
        "Causes": "Aneurysms can develop anywhere along the aorta. Most aortic aneurysms occur in the part of the aorta that's in the belly area, called the abdomen. Several things can lead to the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, including: Hardening of the arteries, called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis occurs when fat and other substances build up on the lining of a blood vessel. High blood pressure. High blood pressure can damage and weaken the aorta's walls. Blood vessel diseases. These are diseases that cause blood vessels to become inflamed. Infection in the aorta. Rarely, infection by certain bacteria or fungi might cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Trauma. For example, being injured in a car accident can cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm.",
        "Risk factors": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm risk factors include: Tobacco use. Smoking is the strongest risk factor for aortic aneurysms. Smoking can weaken the walls of blood vessels, including the aorta. This raises the risk of aortic aneurysm and aneurysm rupture. The longer and more you use tobacco, the greater the chances are of developing an aortic aneurysm. Men ages 65 to 75 who are current or former smokers should have a one-time ultrasound to screen for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Age. Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur most often in people age 65 and older. Being male. Men develop abdominal aortic aneurysms much more often than women do. Being white. People who are white are at higher risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Family history. Having a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms increases the risk of having the condition. Other aneurysms. Having an aneurysm in the aorta in the chest (thoracic aortic aneurysm) or in another large blood vessel, such as the artery behind the knee, might increase the risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. If you're at risk of an aortic aneurysm, medicines may be given to lower your blood pressure and relieve stress on weakened arteries.",
        "Complications": "Complications of abdominal aortic aneurysms include: Tears in one or more of the layers of the wall of the aorta, called an aortic dissection. Rupture of the aneurysm. A rupture can cause life-threatening internal bleeding. In general, the larger the aneurysm and the faster it grows, the greater the risk of rupture. Symptoms that an aortic aneurysm has ruptured can include: Sudden, intense and persistent belly or back pain, which may feel like ripping or tearing. Low blood pressure. Fast pulse. Aortic aneurysms also increase the risk of developing blood clots in the area. If a blood clot breaks loose from the inside wall of an aneurysm, it can block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body. Symptoms of a blocked blood vessel may include pain or reduced blood flow to the legs, toes, kidneys or belly area.",
        "Prevention": "To prevent an abdominal aortic aneurysm or to keep one from worsening, do the following: Don't smoke or use tobacco products. If you smoke or chew tobacco, quit. Also avoid secondhand smoke. If you need help quitting, talk to your health care provider about strategies that may help. Eat a healthy diet. Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, chicken, fish, and low-fat dairy products. Avoid saturated and trans fats and limit salt. Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol under control. If your care provider prescribed medicines, take them as instructed. Get regular exercise. Try to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity. If you haven't been active, start slowly and build up. Talk to your health care provider about what kinds of activities are right for you."

    "Absence seizure": {
        "Overview": "Absence seizures involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness. They're more common in children than in adults. A person having an absence seizure may stare blankly into space for a few seconds. Then the person typically returns quickly to being alert. This type of seizure usually doesn't lead to physical injury. But injury can result during the period when the person loses consciousness. This is particularly true if someone is driving a car or riding a bike when the seizure happens. Absence seizures usually can be controlled with anti-seizure medicines. Some children who have them also develop other seizures, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures or myoclonic seizures. Many children outgrow absence seizures in their teens.",
        "Symptoms": "A simple absence seizure causes a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a brief lapse in attention. The seizure lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 30 seconds. There's no confusion, headache or drowsiness after the seizure. Symptoms of absence seizures include: A sudden stop in activity without falling. Lip smacking. Eyelid flutters. Chewing motions. Finger rubbing. Small movements of both hands. Afterward, there's usually no memory of the incident. But if the seizure is longer, the person may be aware of missed time. Some people have many episodes daily. When it happens, it can interfere with school or daily activities. A child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices them. This is because the seizures are so brief. A decline in a child's learning ability may be the first sign of the seizure disorder. Teachers may say the child has trouble paying attention or that a child is often daydreaming. Contact your child's pediatrician: If you're concerned that your child may be having seizures. If your child has epilepsy but develops symptoms of a new type of seizure. If the seizures continue to occur despite taking anti-seizure medicine. Contact 911 or emergency services in your area: If you observe prolonged automatic behaviors lasting minutes to hours. This may include activities such as eating or moving without awareness. It also might include prolonged confusion. These are possible symptoms of a condition called status epilepticus. After any seizure lasting more than five minutes.",
        "Causes": "Absence seizures usually have a genetic cause. In general, seizures occur as a result of a burst of electrical impulses from nerve cells in the brain, called neurons. Neurons typically send electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect them. In people who have seizures, the brain's usual electrical activity is altered. During an absence seizure, these electrical signals repeat themselves over and over in a three-second pattern. People who have seizures also may have altered levels of the chemical messengers that help the nerve cells communicate with one another. These chemical messengers are called neurotransmitters.",
        "Risk factors": "Certain factors are common to children who have absence seizures, including: Age. Absence seizures are more common in children between the ages of 4 and 14. Sex. Absence seizures are more common in females. Family members who have seizures. Nearly a quarter of children with absence seizures have a close relative who has seizures.",
        "Complications": "While most children outgrow absence seizures, some: Must take anti-seizure medicines throughout life. Eventually have full convulsions, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Other complications can include: Learning problems. Behavior problems. Social isolation. Injury during the seizure.",

    "Acanthosis nigricans": {
        "Overview": "Acanthosis nigricans is a condition that causes areas of dark, thick velvety skin in body folds and creases. It typically affects the armpits, groin and neck. Acanthosis nigricans (ak-an-THOE-sis NIE-grih-kuns) tends to affect people with obesity. Rarely, the skin condition can be a sign of cancer in an internal organ, such as the stomach or liver. Treating the cause of acanthosis nigricans might restore the usual color and texture of the skin.",
        "Symptoms": "The main sign of acanthosis nigricans is dark, thick, velvety skin in body folds and creases. It often appears in the armpits, groin and back of the neck. It develops slowly. The affected skin might be itchy, have an odor and develop skin tags.",
        "Causes": "Acanthosis nigricans might be related to: Insulin resistance. Most people who have acanthosis nigricans have also become resistant to insulin. Insulin is a hormone secreted by the pancreas that allows the body to process sugar. Insulin resistance is what leads to type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance is also related to polycystic ovarian syndrome and might be a factor in why acanthosis nigricans develops. Certain drugs and supplements. High-dose niacin, birth control pills, prednisone and other corticosteroids may cause acanthosis nigricans. Cancer. Some types of cancer cause acanthosis nigricans. These include lymphoma and cancers of the stomach, colon and liver.",
        "Risk factors": "The risk of acanthosis nigricans is higher in people who have obesity. The risk is also higher in people with a family history of the condition, especially in families where obesity and type 2 diabetes are also common.",

    "Achalasia": {
        "Overview": "Achalasia is a swallowing condition that affects the tube connecting the mouth and the stomach, called the esophagus. Damaged nerves make it hard for the muscles of the esophagus to squeeze food and liquid into the stomach. Food then collects in the esophagus, sometimes fermenting and washing back up into the mouth. This fermented food can taste bitter. Achalasia is a fairly rare condition. Some people mistake it for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, in achalasia, the food is coming from the esophagus. In GERD, the material comes from the stomach. There's no cure for achalasia. Once the esophagus is damaged, the muscles cannot work properly again. But symptoms can usually be managed with endoscopy, minimally invasive therapy or surgery.",
        "Symptoms": "Achalasia symptoms generally appear gradually and get worse over time. Symptoms may include: Difficulty swallowing, called dysphagia, which may feel like food or drink is stuck in the throat. Swallowed food or saliva flowing back into the throat. Heartburn. Belching. Chest pain that comes and goes. Coughing at night. Pneumonia from getting food in the lungs. Weight loss. Vomiting.",
        "Causes": "The exact cause of achalasia is poorly understood. Researchers suspect that it may be caused by a loss of nerve cells in the esophagus. There are theories about what causes this, but viral infection or autoimmune responses are possibilities. Very rarely, achalasia may be caused by an inherited genetic disorder or infection.",
        "Risk factors": "Risk factors for achalasia include: Age. Although achalasia can affect people of all ages, it's more common in people between 25 and 60 years of age. Certain medical conditions. The risk of achalasia is higher in people with allergic disorders, adrenal insufficiency or Allgrove syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic condition.",

    "Achilles tendinitis": {
        "Overview": "Achilles tendinitis is an overuse injury of the Achilles (uh-KILL-eez) tendon, the band of tissue that connects calf muscles at the back of the lower leg to your heel bone. Achilles tendinitis most commonly occurs in runners who have suddenly increased the intensity or duration of their runs. It's also common in middle-aged people who play sports, such as tennis or basketball, only on the weekends. Most cases of Achilles tendinitis can be treated with relatively simple, at-home care under your doctor's supervision. Self-care strategies are usually necessary to prevent recurring episodes. More-serious cases of Achilles tendinitis can lead to tendon tears (ruptures) that may require surgical repair.",
        "Symptoms": "The pain associated with Achilles tendinitis typically begins as a mild ache in the back of the leg or above the heel after running or other sports activity. Episodes of more-severe pain may occur after prolonged running, stair climbing or sprinting. You might also experience tenderness or stiffness, especially in the morning, which usually improves with mild activity.",
        "Causes": "Achilles tendinitis is caused by repetitive or intense strain on the Achilles tendon, the band of tissue that connects your calf muscles to your heel bone. This tendon is used when you walk, run, jump or push up on your toes. The structure of the Achilles tendon weakens with age, which can make it more susceptible to injury — particularly in people who may participate in sports only on the weekends or who have suddenly increased the intensity of their running programs.",
        "Risk factors": "A number of factors may increase your risk of Achilles tendinitis, including: Your sex. Achilles tendinitis occurs most commonly in men. Age. Achilles tendinitis is more common as you age. Physical problems. A naturally flat arch in your foot can put more strain on the Achilles tendon. Obesity and tight calf muscles also can increase tendon strain. Training choices. Running in worn-out shoes can increase your risk of Achilles tendinitis. Tendon pain occurs more frequently in cold weather than in warm weather, and running on hilly terrain also can predispose you to Achilles injury. Medical conditions. People who have psoriasis or high blood pressure are at higher risk of developing Achilles tendinitis. Medications. Certain types of antibiotics, called fluoroquinolones, have been associated with higher rates of Achilles tendinitis.",
        "Complications": "Achilles tendinitis can weaken the tendon, making it more vulnerable to a tear (rupture) — a painful injury that usually requires surgical repair.",
        "Prevention": "While it may not be possible to prevent Achilles tendinitis, you can take measures to reduce your risk: Increase your activity level gradually. If you're just beginning an exercise regimen, start slowly and gradually increase the duration and intensity of the training. Take it easy. Avoid activities that place excessive stress on your tendons, such as hill running. If you participate in a strenuous activity, warm up first by exercising at a slower pace. If you notice pain during a particular exercise, stop and rest. Choose your shoes carefully. The shoes you wear while exercising should provide adequate cushioning for your heel and should have a firm arch support to help reduce the tension in the Achilles tendon. Replace your worn-out shoes. If your shoes are in good condition but don't support your feet, try arch supports in both shoes. Stretch daily. Take the time to stretch your calf muscles and Achilles tendon in the morning, before exercise and after exercise to maintain flexibility. This is especially important to avoid a recurrence of Achilles tendinitis. Strengthen your calf muscles. Strong calf muscles enable the calf and Achilles tendon to better handle the stresses they encounter with activity and exercise. Cross-train. Alternate high-impact activities, such as running and jumping, with low-impact activities, such as cycling and swimming."

    "Achilles tendon rupture": {
        "Overview": "The Achilles tendon is a strong fibrous cord that connects the muscles in the back of your calf to your heel bone. If you overstretch your Achilles tendon, it can tear (rupture).",
        "Symptoms": "Although it's possible to have no signs or symptoms with an Achilles tendon rupture, most people have: The feeling of having been kicked in the calf Pain, possibly severe, and swelling near the heel An inability to bend the foot downward or \"push off\" the injured leg when walking An inability to stand on the toes on the injured leg A popping or snapping sound when the injury occurs Seek medical advice immediately if you hear a pop in your heel, especially if you can't walk properly afterward.",
        "Causes": "Your Achilles tendon helps you point your foot downward, rise on your toes and push off your foot as you walk. You rely on it virtually every time you walk and move your foot. Rupture usually occurs in the section of the tendon situated within 2 1/2 inches (about 6 centimeters) of the point where it attaches to the heel bone. This section might be prone to rupture because blood flow is poor, which also can impair its ability to heal. Ruptures often are caused by a sudden increase in the stress on your Achilles tendon. Common examples include: Increasing the intensity of sports participation, especially in sports that involve jumping Falling from a height Stepping into a hole",
        "Risk factors": "Factors that may increase your risk of Achilles tendon rupture include: Age. The peak age for Achilles tendon rupture is 30 to 40. Sex. Achilles tendon rupture is up to five times more likely to occur in men than in women. Recreational sports. Achilles tendon injuries occur more often during sports that involve running, jumping, and sudden starts and stops — such as soccer, basketball and tennis. Steroid injections. Doctors sometimes inject steroids into an ankle joint to reduce pain and inflammation. However, this medication can weaken nearby tendons and has been associated with Achilles tendon ruptures. Certain antibiotics. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro) or levofloxacin (Levaquin), increase the risk of Achilles tendon rupture. Obesity. Excess weight puts more strain on the tendon.",
        "Complications": "",
        "Prevention": "To reduce your chance of developing Achilles tendon problems, follow these tips: Stretch and strengthen calf muscles. Stretch your calf until you feel a noticeable pull but not pain. Don't bounce during a stretch. Calf-strengthening exercises can also help the muscle and tendon absorb more force and prevent injury. Vary your exercises. Alternate high-impact sports, such as running, with low-impact sports, such as walking, biking or swimming. Avoid activities that place excessive stress on your Achilles tendons, such as hill running and jumping activities. Choose running surfaces carefully. Avoid or limit running on hard or slippery surfaces. Dress properly for cold-weather training, and wear well-fitting athletic shoes with proper cushioning in the heels. Increase training intensity slowly. Achilles tendon injuries commonly occur after an abrupt increase in training intensity. Increase the distance, duration and frequency of your training by no more than 10 percent weekly."

    "ACL injury": {
        "Overview": "The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the key ligaments that help stabilize the knee joint. The ACL connects the thighbone (femur) to the shinbone (tibia). It's most commonly torn during sports that involve sudden stops and changes in direction — such as basketball, soccer, tennis and volleyball.",
        "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of an ACL injury usually include: A loud pop or a \"popping\" sensation in the knee Severe pain and inability to continue activity Rapid swelling Loss of range of motion A feeling of instability or \"giving way\" with weight bearing Seek immediate care if any injury to your knee causes signs or symptoms of an ACL injury. The knee joint is a complex structure of bones, ligaments, tendons and other tissues that work together. It's important to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis to determine the severity of the injury and get proper treatment.",
        "Causes": "Ligaments are strong bands of tissue that connect one bone to another. The ACL, one of two ligaments that cross in the middle of the knee, connects your thighbone to your shinbone and helps stabilize your knee joint. ACL injuries often happen during sports and fitness activities that can put stress on the knee: Suddenly slowing down and changing direction (cutting) Pivoting with your foot firmly planted Landing awkwardly from a jump Stopping suddenly Receiving a direct blow to the knee or having a collision, such as a football tackle When the ligament is damaged, there is usually a partial or complete tear of the tissue. A mild injury may stretch the ligament but leave it intact.",
        "Risk factors": "There are a number of factors that increase your risk of an ACL injury, including: Being female — possibly due to differences in anatomy, muscle strength and hormonal influences Participating in certain sports, such as soccer, football, basketball, gymnastics and downhill skiing Poor conditioning Using faulty movement patterns, such as moving the knees inward during a squat Wearing footwear that doesn't fit properly Using poorly maintained sports equipment, such as ski bindings that aren't adjusted properly Playing on artificial turf",
        "Complications": "People who experience an ACL injury have a higher risk of developing osteoarthritis in the knee. Arthritis may occur even if you have surgery to reconstruct the ligament. Multiple factors likely influence the risk of arthritis, such as the severity of the original injury, the presence of related injuries in the knee joint or the level of activity after treatment.",
        "Prevention": "Proper training and exercise can help reduce the risk of ACL injury. A sports medicine physician, physical therapist, athletic trainer or other specialist in sports medicine can provide assessment, instruction and feedback that can help you reduce risks. Programs to reduce ACL injury include: Exercises to strengthen the core — including the hips, pelvis and lower abdomen — with a goal of training athletes to avoid moving the knee inward during a squat Exercises that strengthen leg muscles, particularly hamstring exercises, to ensure an overall balance in leg muscle strength Training and exercise emphasizing proper technique and knee position when jumping and landing from jumps Training to improve technique when performing pivoting and cutting movements Training to strengthen muscles of the legs, hips and core — as well as training to improve jumping and landing techniques and to prevent inward movement of the knee — may help to reduce the higher ACL injury risk in female athletes. Wear footwear and padding that is appropriate for your sport to help prevent injury. If you downhill ski, make sure your ski bindings are adjusted correctly by a trained professional so that your skis will release appropriately if you fall. Wearing a knee brace doesn't appear to prevent ACL injury or reduce the risk of recurring injury after surgery."

    "Acne": {
        "Overview": "Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages. Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. The pimples and bumps heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up. Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems.",
        "Symptoms": "Acne signs vary depending on the severity of your condition: Whiteheads (closed plugged pores) Blackheads (open plugged pores) Small red, tender bumps (papules) Pimples (pustules), which are papules with pus at their tips  Large, solid, painful lumps under the skin (nodules) Painful, pus-filled lumps under the skin (cystic lesions) Acne usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders. If self-care remedies don't clear your acne, see your primary care doctor. He or she can prescribe stronger medications. If acne persists or is severe, you may want to seek medical treatment from a doctor who specializes in the skin (dermatologist or pediatric dermatologist). For many women, acne can persist for decades, with flares common a week before menstruation. This type of acne tends to clear up without treatment in women who use contraceptives. In older adults, a sudden onset of severe acne may signal an underlying disease requiring medical attention. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that some popular nonprescription acne lotions, cleansers and other skin products can cause a serious reaction. This type of reaction is quite rare, so don't confuse it with any redness, irritation or itchiness that occurs in areas where you've applied medications or products. Seek emergency medical help if after using a skin product you experience: Faintness Difficulty breathing Swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue Tightness of the throat",
        "Causes": "Four main factors cause acne: Excess oil (sebum) production Hair follicles clogged by oil and dead skin cells Bacteria Inflammation Acne typically appears on your face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders because these areas of skin have the most oil (sebaceous) glands. Hair follicles are connected to oil glands. The follicle wall may bulge and produce a whitehead. Or the plug may be open to the surface and darken, causing a blackhead. A blackhead may look like dirt stuck in pores. But actually the pore is congested with bacteria and oil, which turns brown when it's exposed to the air. Pimples are raised red spots with a white center that develop when blocked hair follicles become inflamed or infected with bacteria. Blockages and inflammation deep inside hair follicles produce cystlike lumps beneath the surface of your skin. Other pores in your skin, which are the openings of the sweat glands, aren't usually involved in acne. Certain things may trigger or worsen acne: Hormonal changes. Androgens are hormones that increase in boys and girls during puberty and cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge and make more sebum. Hormone changes during midlife, particularly in women, can lead to breakouts too. Certain medications. Examples include drugs containing corticosteroids, testosterone or lithium. Diet. Studies indicate that consuming certain foods — including carbohydrate-rich foods, such as bread, bagels and chips — may worsen acne. Further study is needed to examine whether people with acne would benefit from following specific dietary restrictions. Stress. Stress doesn't cause acne, but if you have acne already, stress may make it worse. These factors have little effect on acne: Chocolate and greasy foods. Eating chocolate or greasy food has little to no effect on acne. Hygiene. Acne isn't caused by dirty skin. In fact, scrubbing the skin too hard or cleansing with harsh soaps or chemicals irritates the skin and can make acne worse. Cosmetics. Cosmetics don't necessarily worsen acne, especially if you use oil-free makeup that doesn't clog pores (noncomedogenics) and remove makeup regularly. Nonoily cosmetics don't interfere with the effectiveness of acne drugs.",
        "Risk factors": "Risk factors for acne include: Age. People of all ages can get acne, but it's most common in teenagers. Hormonal changes. Such changes are common during puberty or pregnancy. Family history. Genetics plays a role in acne. If both of your parents had acne, you're likely to develop it too. Greasy or oily substances. You may develop acne where your skin comes into contact with oil or oily lotions and creams. Friction or pressure on your skin. This can be caused by items such as telephones, cellphones, helmets, tight collars and backpacks.",
        "Complications": "People with darker skin types are more likely than are people with lighter skin to experience these acne complications: Scars. Pitted skin (acne scars) and thick scars (keloids) can remain long-term after acne has healed. Skin changes. After acne has cleared, the affected skin may be darker (hyperpigmented) or lighter (hypopigmented) than before the condition occurred.",

    "Acoustic neuroma": {
        "Overview": "An acoustic neuroma is a noncancerous tumor that develops on the main nerve leading from the inner ear to the brain. This nerve is called the vestibular nerve. Branches of the nerve directly affect balance and hearing. Pressure from an acoustic neuroma can cause hearing loss, ringing in the ear and problems with balance. Another name for an acoustic neuroma is vestibular schwannoma. An acoustic neuroma develops from the Schwann cells covering the vestibular nerve. An acoustic neuroma is usually slow-growing. Rarely, it may grow quickly and become large enough to press against the brain and affect vital functions. Treatments for an acoustic neuroma include monitoring, radiation and surgical removal.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are often easy to miss and may take years to develop. Symptoms may occur because of the tumor's effects on the hearing and balance nerves. The tumor also can put pressure on nearby nerves controlling facial muscles, known as the facial nerve, and sensation, known as the trigeminal nerve. Blood vessels or brain structures also can be affected by an acoustic neuroma. As the tumor grows, it may be more likely to cause more noticeable or worse symptoms. Common symptoms of an acoustic neuroma include: Hearing loss, usually gradually over months to years. In rare cases, hearing loss can be sudden. Hearing loss usually occurs on one side or is worse on one side. Ringing in the affected ear, known as tinnitus. Loss of balance or not feeling steady. Dizziness. Facial numbness and, very rarely, weakness or loss of muscle movement. Rarely, an acoustic neuroma may grow large enough to compress the brainstem and become life-threatening. See a health care professional if you notice hearing loss in one ear, ringing in your ear or balance problems. Early diagnosis of an acoustic neuroma may help keep the tumor from growing large enough to cause complications such as total hearing loss.",
        "Causes": "The cause of acoustic neuromas can sometimes be linked to a problem with a gene on chromosome 22. Typically, this gene produces a tumor suppressor protein that helps control the growth of Schwann cells covering the nerves. Experts don't know what causes this problem with the gene. Often there is no known cause for an acoustic neuroma. This gene change is inherited in people with a rare disorder called neurofibromatosis type 2. People with neurofibromatosis type 2 usually have growth of tumors on the hearing and balance nerves on both sides of the head. These tumors are known as bilateral vestibular schwannomas.",
        "Risk factors": "The only confirmed risk factor for acoustic neuromas is having a parent with the rare genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 2. However, neurofibromatosis type 2 only accounts for about 5% of acoustic neuroma cases. A hallmark characteristic of neurofibromatosis type 2 is noncancerous tumors on the balance nerves on both sides of the head. Tumors also may develop on other nerves. Neurofibromatosis type 2 is known as an autosomal dominant disorder. This means that the gene related to the disorder can be passed to a child by just one parent. Each child of an affected parent has a 50-50 chance of inheriting it.",
        "Complications": "An acoustic neuroma may cause permanent complications, including: Hearing loss. Facial numbness and weakness. Balance problems. Ringing in the ear. Large tumors may press on the brainstem, occasionally preventing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid between the brain and spinal cord. Fluid can build up in your head, a condition known as hydrocephalus. This increases the pressure inside the skull.",

    "Acromegaly": {
        "Overview": "Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that develops when your pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone during adulthood. When you have too much growth hormone, your bones increase in size. In childhood, this leads to increased height and is called gigantism. But in adulthood, a change in height doesn't occur. Instead, the increase in bone size is limited to the bones of your hands, feet and face, and is called acromegaly. Because acromegaly is uncommon and the physical changes occur slowly over many years, the condition sometimes takes a long time to recognize. Untreated, high levels of growth hormone can affect other parts of the body, in addition to your bones. This can lead to serious — sometimes even life-threatening — health problems. But treatment can reduce your risk of complications and significantly improve your symptoms, including the enlargement of your features.",
        "Symptoms": "A common sign of acromegaly is enlarged hands and feet. For example, you may notice that you aren't able to put on rings that used to fit, and that your shoe size has progressively increased. Acromegaly may also cause gradual changes in your face's shape, such as a protruding lower jaw and brow bone, an enlarged nose, thickened lips, and wider spacing between your teeth. Because acromegaly tends to progress slowly, early signs may not be obvious for years. Sometimes, people notice the physical changes only by comparing old photos with newer ones. Overall, acromegaly signs and symptoms tend to vary from one person to another, and may include any of the following: Enlarged hands and feet. Enlarged facial features, including the facial bones, lips, nose and tongue. Coarse, oily, thickened skin. Excessive sweating and body odor. Small outgrowths of skin tissue (skin tags). Fatigue and joint or muscle weakness. Pain and limited joint mobility. A deepened, husky voice due to enlarged vocal cords and sinuses. Severe snoring due to obstruction of the upper airway. Vision problems. Headaches, which may be persistent or severe. Menstrual cycle irregularities in women. Erectile dysfunction in men. Loss of interest in sex. If you have signs and symptoms associated with acromegaly, contact your doctor for an exam. Acromegaly usually develops slowly. Even your family members may not notice the gradual physical changes that occur with this disorder at first. But early diagnosis is important so that you can start getting proper care. Acromegaly can lead to serious health problems if it's not treated.",
        "Causes": "Acromegaly occurs when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone (GH) over a long period of time. The pituitary gland is a small gland at the base of your brain, behind the bridge of your nose. It produces GH and a number of other hormones. GH plays an important role in managing your physical growth. When the pituitary gland releases GH into your bloodstream, it triggers your liver to produce a hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) — sometimes also called insulin-like growth factor-I, or IGF-I. IGF-1 is what causes your bones and other tissues to grow. Too much GH leads to too much IGF-1, which can cause acromegaly signs, symptoms and complications. In adults, a tumor is the most common cause of too much GH production: Pituitary tumors. Most acromegaly cases are caused by a noncancerous (benign) tumor (adenoma) of the pituitary gland. The tumor produces excessive amounts of growth hormone, causing many of the signs and symptoms of acromegaly. Some of the symptoms of acromegaly, such as headaches and impaired vision, are due to the tumor pressing on nearby brain tissues. Nonpituitary tumors. In a few people with acromegaly, tumors in other parts of the body, such as the lungs or pancreas, cause the disorder. Sometimes, these tumors secrete GH. In other cases, the tumors produce a hormone called growth hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH), which signals the pituitary gland to make more GH.",
        "Risk factors": "People who have a rare genetic condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1), have a higher risk of developing acromegaly. In MEN 1, the endocrine glands — usually the parathyroid glands, pancreas and pituitary gland — grow tumors and release extra hormones. Those hormones may trigger acromegaly.",
        "Complications": "If left untreated, acromegaly can lead to major health problems. Complications may include: High blood pressure (hypertension). High cholesterol. Heart problems, particularly enlargement of the heart (cardiomyopathy). Osteoarthritis. Type 2 diabetes. Enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter). Precancerous growths (polyps) on the lining of your colon. Sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. Carpal tunnel syndrome. Increased risk of cancerous tumors. Spinal cord compression or fractures. Vision changes or vision loss. Early treatment of acromegaly can prevent these complications from developing or becoming worse. Untreated, acromegaly and its complications can lead to premature death.",

    "Actinic keratosis": {
        "Overview": "An actinic keratosis (ak-TIN-ik ker-uh-TOE-sis) is a rough, scaly patch on the skin that develops from years of sun exposure. It's often found on the face, lips, ears, forearms, scalp, neck or back of the hands.",
        "Symptoms": "Actinic keratoses vary in appearance. Symptoms include: Rough, dry or scaly patch of skin, usually less than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in diameter Flat to slightly raised patch or bump on the top layer of skin In some cases, a hard, wartlike surface Color variations, including pink, red or brown Itching, burning, bleeding or crusting New patches or bumps on sun-exposed areas of the head, neck, hands and forearms",
        "Causes": "An actinic keratosis is caused by frequent or intense exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun or tanning beds.",
        "Risk factors": "Anyone can develop actinic keratoses. But you're at increased risk if you: Have red or blond hair and blue or light-colored eyes Have a history of a lot of sun exposure or sunburn Tend to freckle or burn when exposed to sunlight Are older than 40 Live in a sunny place Work outdoors Have a weakened immune system",
        "Complications": "If treated early, actinic keratosis can be cleared up or removed. If left untreated, some of these spots might progress to squamous cell carcinoma. This is a type of cancer that usually isn't life-threatening if detected and treated early.",
        "Prevention": "Sun safety helps prevent actinic keratoses. Take these steps to protect your skin from the sun: Limit your time in the sun. Especially avoid time in the sun between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. And avoid staying in the sun so long that you get a sunburn or a suntan. Use sunscreen. Before spending time outdoors, apply a broad-spectrum water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30, as the American Academy of Dermatology recommends. Do this even on cloudy days. Use sunscreen on all exposed skin. And use lip balm with sunscreen on your lips. Apply sunscreen at least 15 minutes before going outside and reapply it every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or sweating. Sunscreen is not recommended for babies under 6 months. Rather, keep them out of the sun if possible. Or protect them with shade, hats, and clothing that covers the arms and legs. Cover up. For extra protection from the sun, wear tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs. Also wear a broad-brimmed hat. This provides more protection than does a baseball cap or golf visor. Avoid tanning beds. The UV exposure from a tanning bed can cause just as much skin damage as a tan from the sun. Check your skin regularly and report changes to your health care provider. Examine your skin regularly, looking for the development of new skin growths or changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp. Examine the tops and undersides of your arms and hands."

    "Acute coronary syndrome": {
        "Overview": "Acute coronary syndrome is a term that describes a range of conditions related to sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart. These conditions include a heart attack and unstable angina. A heart attack happens when cell death damages or destroys heart tissue. A heart attack also is known as a myocardial infarction. Unstable angina occurs when blood flow to the heart decreases. It's not severe enough to cause cell death or a heart attack. But the reduced blood flow may increase your risk of a heart attack. Acute coronary syndrome often causes severe chest pain or discomfort. It is a medical emergency that needs a diagnosis and care right away. The goals of treatment include improving blood flow, treating complications and preventing future problems.",
        "Symptoms": "The symptoms of acute coronary syndrome usually begin suddenly. They include: Chest pain or discomfort. This is often described as aching, pressure, tightness or burning. Chest pain also is called angina. Pain that starts in the chest and spreads to other parts of the body. These areas include the shoulders, arms, upper belly area, back, neck or jaw. Nausea or vomiting. Indigestion. Shortness of breath, also called dyspnea. Sudden, heavy sweating. Racing heartbeat. Feeling lightheaded or dizzy. Fainting. Unusual fatigue. Chest pain or discomfort is the most common symptom. But symptoms may vary quite a bit depending on your age, sex and other medical conditions. You're more likely to have symptoms without chest pain or discomfort if you're a woman, an older adult or have diabetes. Acute coronary syndrome is a medical emergency. Chest pain or discomfort can be a symptom of many life-threatening conditions. Get emergency help for a diagnosis and appropriate care right away. Do not drive yourself to the hospital.",
        "Causes": "Acute coronary syndrome usually results from the buildup of fatty deposits on the walls of blood vessels that deliver blood, oxygen and nutrients to heart muscles. Fatty deposits also are called plaque. The blood vessels that supply the heart also are known as coronary arteries. When a fatty deposit ruptures or splits, a blood clot forms. This clot blocks the flow of blood to heart muscles. When the supply of oxygen to cells is too low, cells in the heart muscles can die. The death of cells results in damage to muscle tissues. This is called a heart attack. Even when there is no cell death, the drop in oxygen still results in heart muscles that don't work the way they should. This change may be short-lived or permanent. When acute coronary syndrome doesn't result in cell death, it is called unstable angina.",
        "Risk factors": "The risk factors for acute coronary syndrome are the same as those for other types of heart disease. Risk factors include: Getting older. High blood pressure. High blood cholesterol. Smoking tobacco. Lack of physical activity. Eating an unhealthy diet. Obesity or overweight. Diabetes. Personal or family history of chest pain, heart attacks or stroke. History of high blood pressure, preeclampsia or diabetes during pregnancy, and early menopause. COVID-19 infection.",

    "Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)": {
        "Overview": "Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a rare but serious condition that affects the spinal cord. It can cause sudden weakness in the arms or legs, loss of muscle tone, and loss of reflexes. The condition mainly affects young children. Most children have a mild respiratory illness or fever caused by a viral infection about one to four weeks before developing symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis. If you or your child develops symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis, seek immediate medical care. Symptoms can progress rapidly. Hospitalization is needed and sometimes a ventilator is required for breathing support. Since experts began tracking acute flaccid myelitis following initial clusters in 2014, outbreaks in the United States have occurred in 2016 and 2018. Outbreaks tend to occur between August and November.",
        "Symptoms": "The most common signs and symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis include: Sudden arm or leg weakness Sudden loss of muscle tone Sudden loss of reflexes Other possible signs and symptoms include: Difficulty moving the eyes or drooping eyelids Facial droop or weakness Difficulty with swallowing or slurred speech Pain in the arms, legs, neck or back Uncommon symptoms might include: Numbness or tingling Inability to pass urine Severe symptoms involve respiratory failure, due to the muscles involved in breathing becoming weak. It's also possible to experience life-threatening body temperature changes and blood pressure instability.",
        "Causes": "Acute flaccid myelitis might be caused by an infection with a type of virus known as an enterovirus. Respiratory illnesses and fever from enteroviruses are common — especially in children. Most people recover. It's not clear why some people with an enterovirus infection develop acute flaccid myelitis. In the United States many viruses, including enteroviruses, circulate between August and November. This is when acute flaccid myelitis outbreaks tend to occur. The symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis can look similar to those of the viral disease polio. But none of the acute flaccid myelitis cases in the United States have been caused by poliovirus.",
        "Risk factors": "Acute flaccid myelitis mainly affects young children.",
        "Complications": "Muscle weakness caused by acute flaccid myelitis can continue for months to years.",
        "Prevention": "There's no specific way to prevent acute flaccid myelitis. However, preventing a viral infection can help reduce the risk of developing acute flaccid myelitis. Take these steps to help protect yourself or your child from getting or spreading a viral infection: Wash your hands often with soap and water. Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or upper shirt sleeve. Keep sick children at home."

    "Acute kidney injury": {
        "Overview": "Acute kidney injury happens when the kidneys suddenly can't filter waste products from the blood. When the kidneys can't filter wastes, harmful levels of wastes may build up. The blood's chemical makeup may get out of balance. Acute kidney injury used to be called acute kidney failure. Acute kidney injury is most common in people who are in the hospital, mostly in people who need intensive care. Acute kidney injury ranges from mild to severe. If severe, ongoing and not treated, it can be fatal. But it also can be reversed. People in otherwise good health may get back typical or nearly typical use of their kidneys.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms of acute kidney injury may include: Less urine output. Fluid buildup, which can cause shortness of breath and swelling in the legs, ankles or feet. Tiredness. Confusion or fogginess. Nausea. Pain in the belly or in the side below the rib cage. Weakness. Irregular heartbeat. Itching. Loss of appetite. Chest pain or pressure. Seizures or coma in severe cases. Sometimes acute kidney injury causes no symptoms. Then it may be found through lab tests done for something else. See your healthcare professional right away or seek emergency care if you have symptoms of acute kidney injury.",
        "Causes": "Acute kidney injury can happen when: You have a condition that slows blood flow to your kidneys. You have damage to your kidneys. Your kidneys' urine drainage tubes, called ureters, get blocked. Conditions that may slow blood flow to the kidneys and lead to kidney injury include: Loss of too much body fluid, called dehydration. Infection with or without sepsis or septic shock. Medicines such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve). Blood or fluid loss. Severe low blood pressure from blood pressure medicines. Heart attack. Heart failure or heart disease. Liver cirrhosis or failure. Bad allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis. Bad burns. The following may damage the kidneys and lead to acute kidney injury: Swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the tiny filters in the kidneys. This is called glomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-loe-nuh-FRY-tis). Medicines, such as certain chemotherapy drugs, antibiotics and dyes used during imaging tests. Infection, such as with the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Toxins, such as alcohol, heavy metals and cocaine. An immune system condition called lupus that causes glomerulonephritis. Blood clots in the veins and arteries in and around the kidneys. Cholesterol deposits that block blood flow in the kidneys. A condition that results from red blood cells being destroyed too early, called hemolytic uremic syndrome. A group of rare diseases affecting the skin and connective tissues called scleroderma. A rare blood disorder called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Muscle tissue breakdown, called rhabdomyolysis. The toxins from the muscle being destroyed leads to kidney damage. Breakdown of tumor cells called tumor lysis syndrome. This leads to the release of toxins that can injure the kidneys. Conditions that keep urine from leaving the body are called urinary obstruction. These can lead to acute kidney injury. They include: Kidney stones. Enlarged prostate. Blood clots in the urinary tract. Bladder cancer. Prostate cancer. Cervical cancer. Colon cancer. Growth pushing on the ureters. Nerve damage of the nerves that control the bladder.",
        "Risk factors": "Acute kidney injury almost always is linked to another medical condition or event. Conditions that can increase your risk of acute kidney injury include: Ongoing kidney disease, also called chronic kidney disease. Older age, but it does happen to children. Being in the hospital, most often for a serious condition that needs intensive care. Blockages in the blood vessels in your arms or legs, called peripheral artery disease. Diabetes, especially if it's not controlled. High blood pressure. Heart failure. Liver diseases. Certain cancers and their treatments.",
        "Complications": "Complications of acute kidney injury may include: Fluid buildup. A buildup of fluid in your lungs can cause shortness of breath. Chest pain. The lining that covers your heart, called the pericardium, can get inflamed. This can cause chest pain. Muscle weakness. This can result from the body's fluids and minerals in the blood called electrolytes being out of balance. Permanent kidney damage. Sometimes, acute kidney injury causes lifelong loss of the use of the kidneys, called end-stage renal disease. People with end-stage renal disease need either lifelong treatments to remove waste from the body, called dialysis, or a kidney transplant to survive. Death. Acute kidney injury can cause the kidneys to stop working.",
        "Prevention": "You might cut your risk of acute kidney injury by taking care of your kidneys. Try to: Get treated quickly for bad infections. Work with your healthcare team to manage kidney and other ongoing conditions. Kidney disease, diabetes or high blood pressure increases your risk of acute kidney injury. If you have one of these, do what your healthcare team tells you to manage your condition. If you have risk factors for kidney disease, check with your healthcare team to be sure that prescription medicines you take are safe for your kidneys. Read labels when taking pain medicines available without a prescription. Do what the label says when taking medicines such as aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Taking too much of these medicines may increase your risk of kidney injury. This is especially true if you already have kidney disease, diabetes or high blood pressure. Live a healthy lifestyle. Be active and eat a healthy, balanced diet. If you drink alcohol, drink only in moderation."

    "Acute liver failure": {
        "Overview": "Acute liver failure is loss of liver function that occurs quickly — in days or weeks — usually in a person who has no preexisting liver disease. It's most commonly caused by a hepatitis virus or drugs, such as acetaminophen. Acute liver failure is less common than chronic liver failure, which develops more slowly. Acute liver failure, also known as fulminant hepatic failure, can cause serious complications, including bleeding and increased pressure in the brain. It's a medical emergency that requires hospitalization. Depending on the cause, acute liver failure can sometimes be reversed with treatment. In many situations, though, a liver transplant may be the only cure.",
        "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of acute liver failure may include: Yellowing of your skin and eyeballs (jaundice) Pain in your upper right abdomen A swollen belly (ascites) Nausea Vomiting A general sense of feeling unwell (malaise) Disorientation or confusion Sleepiness Breath may have a musty or sweet odor Tremors Acute liver failure can develop quickly in an otherwise healthy person, and it is life-threatening. If you or someone you know suddenly develops a yellowing of the eyes or skin; tenderness in the upper abdomen; or any unusual changes in mental state, personality or behavior, seek medical attention right away.",
        "Causes": "Acute liver failure occurs when liver cells are damaged significantly and are no longer able to function. Potential causes include: Acetaminophen overdose. Taking too much acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States. Outside of the United States, acetaminophen is known as paracetamol. Acute liver failure can occur after one very large dose of acetaminophen, or after higher than recommended doses every day for several days. If you or someone you know has taken an overdose of acetaminophen, seek medical attention as quickly as possible. Treatment may prevent liver failure. Don't wait for the signs of liver failure. Prescription medications. Some prescription medications, including antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anticonvulsants, can cause acute liver failure. Herbal supplements. Herbal drugs and supplements, including kava, ephedra, skullcap and pennyroyal, have been linked to acute liver failure. Hepatitis and other viruses. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis E can cause acute liver failure. Other viruses that can cause acute liver failure include Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. Toxins. Toxins that can cause acute liver failure include the poisonous wild mushroom Amanita phalloides, which is sometimes mistaken for one that is safe to eat. Carbon tetrachloride is another toxin that can cause acute liver failure. It is an industrial chemical found in refrigerants and solvents for waxes, varnishes and other materials. Autoimmune disease. Liver failure can be caused by autoimmune hepatitis — a disease in which your immune system attacks liver cells, causing inflammation and injury. Diseases of the veins in the liver. Vascular diseases, such as Budd-Chiari syndrome, can cause blockages in the veins of the liver and lead to acute liver failure. Metabolic disease. Rare metabolic diseases, such as Wilson's disease and acute fatty liver of pregnancy, infrequently cause acute liver failure. Cancer. Cancer that either begins in or spreads to your liver can cause your liver to fail. Shock. Overwhelming infection (sepsis) and shock can severely reduce blood flow to the liver, causing liver failure. Heat stroke. Extreme physical activity in a hot environment can trigger acute liver failure. Some cases of acute liver failure have no obvious cause.",
        "Risk factors": "",
        "Complications": "Acute liver failure often causes complications, including: Too much fluid in the brain (cerebral edema). Too much fluid causes pressure to build up in your brain, which can lead to disorientation, severe mental confusion and seizures. Bleeding and bleeding disorders. A failing liver cannot make enough clotting factors, which help blood to clot. Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract is common with this condition. It may be difficult to control. Infections. People with acute liver failure are more likely to develop infections, particularly in the blood and in the respiratory and urinary tracts. Kidney failure. Kidney failure often occurs after liver failure, especially if you had an acetaminophen overdose, which damages both your liver and your kidneys.",
        "Prevention": "Reduce your risk of acute liver failure by taking care of your liver. Follow instructions on medications. If you take acetaminophen or other medications, check the package insert for the recommended dosage, and don't take more than that. If you already have liver disease, ask your health care provider if it is safe to take any amount of acetaminophen. Tell your provider about all your medicines. Even over-the-counter and herbal medicines can interfere with prescription drugs you're taking. Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. Avoid risky behavior. Get help if you use illicit intravenous drugs. Don't share needles. Use condoms during sex. If you get tattoos or body piercings, make sure the shop you choose is clean and safe. Don't smoke. Get vaccinated. If you have chronic liver disease, a history of any type of hepatitis infection or an increased risk of hepatitis, talk to your provider about getting the hepatitis B vaccine. A vaccine also is available for hepatitis A. Avoid contact with other people's blood and body fluids. Accidental needle sticks or improper cleanup of blood or body fluids can spread hepatitis viruses. Sharing razor blades or toothbrushes also can spread infection. Don't eat wild mushrooms. It can be difficult to tell the difference between a poisonous mushroom and one that is safe to eat. Take care with aerosol sprays. When you use an aerosol cleaner, make sure the room is ventilated, or wear a mask. Take similar protective measures when spraying insecticides, fungicides, paint and other toxic chemicals. Follow product instructions carefully. Watch what gets on your skin. When using insecticides and other toxic chemicals, cover your skin with gloves, long sleeves, a hat and a mask. Maintain a healthy weight. Obesity can cause a condition called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which may include fatty liver, hepatitis and cirrhosis."

        "Overview": "Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow — the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made. The word \"acute\" in acute lymphocytic leukemia comes from the fact that the disease progresses rapidly and creates immature blood cells, rather than mature ones. The word \"lymphocytic\" in acute lymphocytic leukemia refers to the white blood cells called lymphocytes, which ALL affects. Acute lymphocytic leukemia is also known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Acute lymphocytic leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children, and treatments result in a good chance for a cure. Acute lymphocytic leukemia can also occur in adults, though the chance of a cure is greatly reduced.",
        "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia may include: Bleeding from the gums Bone pain Fever Frequent infections Frequent or severe nosebleeds Lumps caused by swollen lymph nodes in and around the neck, armpits, abdomen or groin Pale skin Shortness of breath Weakness, fatigue or a general decrease in energy Make an appointment with your doctor or your child's doctor if you notice any persistent signs and symptoms that concern you. Many signs and symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia mimic those of the flu. However, flu signs and symptoms eventually improve. If signs and symptoms don't improve as expected, make an appointment with your doctor.",
        "Causes": "Acute lymphocytic leukemia occurs when a bone marrow cell develops changes (mutations) in its genetic material or DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. Normally, the DNA tells the cell to grow at a set rate and to die at a set time. In acute lymphocytic leukemia, the mutations tell the bone marrow cell to continue growing and dividing. When this happens, blood cell production becomes out of control. The bone marrow produces immature cells that develop into leukemic white blood cells called lymphoblasts. These abnormal cells are unable to function properly, and they can build up and crowd out healthy cells. It's not clear what causes the DNA mutations that can lead to acute lymphocytic leukemia.",

    "Addison's disease": {
        "Overview": "Addison's disease, also called adrenal insufficiency, is an uncommon illness that occurs when the body doesn't make enough of certain hormones. In Addison's disease, the adrenal glands make too little cortisol and, often, too little of another hormone, aldosterone. Addison's disease can affect anyone and can be life-threatening. Treatment involves taking hormones to replace those that are missing.",
        "Symptoms": "Addison's disease symptoms usually happen slowly, often over months. The disease can move so slowly that people who have it may ignore the symptoms at first. Then a stress, such as illness or injury, makes symptoms worse. Symptoms may include: Extreme fatigue Weight loss and loss of appetite Areas of darkened skin Low blood pressure, even fainting Salt craving Low blood sugar, also called hypoglycemia Nausea, diarrhea or vomiting Abdominal pain Muscle and joint pain Irritability Depression Body hair loss or sexual issues in some people Sometimes the symptoms of Addison's disease appear suddenly. Acute adrenal failure can lead to life-threatening shock. Seek emergency treatment for the following: Severe weakness Confusion Pain in the lower back or legs Severe abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, leading to dehydration Reduced consciousness or delirium Low blood pressure See a health care provider if you have common symptoms of Addison's disease, such as: Darkened areas of skin Extreme loss of body water, also known as dehydration Severe fatigue Weight loss that doesn't happen on purpose Nausea, vomiting or belly pain Lightheadedness or fainting Salt cravings Muscle or joint pains",
        "Causes": "Addison's disease is caused by damage to the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands sit just above the kidneys. As part of the endocrine system, they make hormones that affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. Damage to these glands results in too little of the hormone cortisol and, often, the hormone aldosterone. The adrenal glands are made up of two sections. The interior, called the medulla, makes adrenaline-like hormones. The outer layer, called the cortex, makes a group of hormones called corticosteroids. Corticosteroids include: Glucocorticoids. These hormones, including cortisol, affect the body's ability to turn food into energy. They also play a role in the immune system's inflammatory response and help the body respond to stress. Mineralocorticoids. These hormones, including aldosterone, balance the body's sodium and potassium to keep blood pressure in a healthy range. Androgens. In all people, the adrenal glands make small amounts of these sex hormones. They cause male sexual development. And they affect muscle mass, sex drive, known as libido, and a sense of well-being in all people. Sometimes, the outer layer of the adrenal glands, known as the cortex, is damaged. Then it can't make enough hormones, a condition called primary adrenal insufficiency. This is usually the result of an autoimmune disease, in which the body attacks itself. People with Addison's disease are more likely than are other people to have another autoimmune disease as well. Other causes of adrenal gland failure may include: Tuberculosis. Other infections of the adrenal glands. Spread of cancer to the adrenal glands. Bleeding into the adrenal glands. Medicines that block the body's ability to make glucocorticoid, such as ketoconazole and etomidate (Amidate). Or medicines that block the action of glucocorticoid in the body, such as mifepristone (Mifeprex, Korlym). Treatment for cancer with medicines called checkpoint inhibitors. The pituitary gland makes a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH in turn causes the adrenal cortex to make its hormones. Having pituitary tumors that aren't cancer, inflammation and pituitary surgery can cause the pituitary gland to make too little ACTH. Too little ACTH can cause the adrenal glands to make too little glucocorticoids and androgens. This is called secondary adrenal insufficiency. Most symptoms of secondary adrenal insufficiency are similar to those of primary adrenal insufficiency. However, people with secondary adrenal insufficiency don't have darkened skin and are less likely to have severe dehydration or low blood pressure. They're more likely to have low blood sugar. A temporary cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when people who take corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to treat conditions such as asthma or arthritis, stop taking the medicine suddenly rather than tapering off.",
        "Risk factors": "Most people who get Addison's disease don't have any factors that put them at higher risk of developing the condition. But the following may raise the risk of developing Addison's disease: A history of having a disease or surgery that affects the pituitary gland or the adrenal glands. Certain genetic changes that affect the pituitary or adrenal glands. These include gene changes that cause the inherited disease congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Other autoimmune endocrine conditions, such as hypothyroidism or type 1 diabetes. A traumatic brain injury.",
        "Complications": "Addisonian crisis. If you have untreated Addison's disease, you may develop an addisonian crisis as a result of stress on the body, such as injury, infection or illness. Typically, the adrenal glands make two or three times the usual amount of cortisol in response to physical stress. With adrenal insufficiency, not being able to increase the amount of cortisol made as a result of stress can lead to an addisonian crisis. An addisonian crisis is a life-threatening situation that results in low blood pressure, low blood levels of sugar and high blood levels of potassium. It requires immediate medical care.  Other autoimmune diseases. People with Addison's disease often have related autoimmune diseases.",
        "Prevention": "Addison's disease can't be prevented, but there are ways to avoid an addisonian crisis: Talk to your health care provider if you always feel tired or weak or are losing weight without trying. Ask about an adrenal shortage. If you have been diagnosed with Addison's disease, ask your provider what to do when you're sick. You may need to learn how to increase your dose of corticosteroids. If you become very sick, especially if you are vomiting and you can't take your medicine, go to an emergency room. Some people with Addison's disease worry about serious side effects from hydrocortisone or prednisone. However, people with Addison's disease aren't as likely to get the side effects of high-dose glucocorticoids. That's because the dose prescribed replaces the amount that's missing. If you take cortisone, be sure to follow up with your provider regularly to make sure your dose is not too high."

    "Adenomyosis": {
        "Overview": "Adenomyosis (ad-uh-no-my-O-sis) occurs when the tissue that normally lines the uterus (endometrial tissue) grows into the muscular wall of the uterus. The displaced tissue continues to act normally — thickening, breaking down and bleeding — during each menstrual cycle. An enlarged uterus and painful, heavy periods can result. Doctors aren't sure what causes adenomyosis, but the disease usually resolves after menopause. For women who have severe discomfort from adenomyosis, hormonal treatments can help. Removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) cures adenomyosis",
        "Symptoms": "Sometimes, adenomyosis causes no signs or symptoms or only mild discomfort. However, adenomyosis can cause: Heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding Severe cramping or sharp, knifelike pelvic pain during menstruation (dysmenorrhea) Chronic pelvic pain Painful intercourse (dyspareunia) Your uterus might get bigger. Although you might not know if your uterus is bigger, you may notice tenderness or pressure in your lower abdomen.",
        "Causes": "The cause of adenomyosis isn't known. There have been many theories, including: Invasive tissue growth. Some experts believe that endometrial cells from the lining of the uterus invade the muscle that forms the uterine walls. Uterine incisions made during an operation such as a cesarean section (C-section) might promote the direct invasion of the endometrial cells into the wall of the uterus. Developmental origins. Other experts suspect that endometrial tissue is deposited in the uterine muscle when the uterus is first formed in the fetus. Uterine inflammation related to childbirth. Another theory suggests a link between adenomyosis and childbirth. Inflammation of the uterine lining during the postpartum period might cause a break in the normal boundary of cells that line the uterus. Stem cell origins. A recent theory proposes that bone marrow stem cells might invade the uterine muscle, causing adenomyosis. Regardless of how adenomyosis develops, its growth depends on the body's circulating estrogen.",
        "Risk factors": "Risk factors for adenomyosis include: Prior uterine surgery, such as C-section, fibroid removal, or dilatation and curettage (D&C) Childbirth Middle age Most cases of adenomyosis — which depends on estrogen — are found in women in their 40s and 50s. Adenomyosis in these women could relate to longer exposure to estrogen compared with that of younger women. However, current research suggests that the condition might also be common in younger women.",
        "Complications": "If you often have prolonged, heavy bleeding during your periods, you can develop chronic anemia, which causes fatigue and other health problems. Although not harmful, the pain and excessive bleeding associated with adenomyosis can disrupt your lifestyle. You might avoid activities you've enjoyed in the past because you're in pain or you worry that you might start bleeding.",

    "Adjustment disorders": {
        "Overview": "Adjustment disorders are excessive reactions to stress that involve negative thoughts, strong emotions and changes in behavior. The reaction to a stressful change or event is much more intense than would typically be expected. This can cause a lot of problems in getting along with others, as well as at work or school. Work problems, going away to school, an illness or any number of life changes can cause stress. Most of the time, people get used to such changes within a few months. But if you have an adjustment disorder, you continue to have emotional or behavioral responses that can make you feel more anxious or depressed. Treatment can help you regain your emotional well-being.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms depend on the type of adjustment disorder. These symptoms can vary from person to person. You experience more stress than would generally be expected in response to a trying event, and this stress causes a lot of problems in your life. Adjustment disorders affect how you feel and think about yourself and the world. They also may affect your actions or behavior. Some examples include: Feeling sad, hopeless or not enjoying things you used to enjoy. Crying often. Worrying, or feeling anxious, nervous, jittery or stressed out. Feeling irritable or like you can't handle anything and don't know where to start. Having trouble sleeping. Not eating enough. Having difficulty concentrating. Having difficulty with daily activities. Withdrawing from family and friends who support you socially. Not doing important things, such as going to work or paying bills. Thinking about suicide or acting on those thoughts. Symptoms of an adjustment disorder start within three months of a stressful event. These symptoms last no longer than six months after the end of the stressful event. But constant or lasting adjustment disorders can continue for more than six months. This is especially true if the stressful event is ongoing, such as being unemployed. Stressors are usually temporary. You learn to cope with them over time. Symptoms of adjustment disorder usually get better when the stress eases. But sometimes the stressful event continues to be a part of your life. Or a new stressful situation comes up, and you face the same emotional struggles all over again. Talk to your doctor or a mental health professional if you continue to struggle or if you're having trouble getting through each day. You can get treatment to help you cope better with stressful events and feel better about life again. If you have concerns about your child's behavior, talk with your child's doctor. The risk of suicide can be higher in people who have adjustment disorders. If you're thinking about suicide, contact a hotline for counseling: In the U.S., call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. It's available 24 hours a day, every day. Or use the Lifeline Chat. Services are free and private. U.S. veterans or service members who are in crisis can call 988 and then press \"1\" for the Veterans Crisis Line. Or text 838255. Or chat online. The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish-language phone line at 1-888-628-9454 (toll-free).",
        "Causes": "Adjustment disorders are caused by major changes or stressors in your life. Genetics, your life experiences and your temperament may make it more likely that an adjustment disorder happens.",
        "Risk factors": "Stressful life events and experiences ― positive and negative ― may put you at risk of having an adjustment disorder. Examples include: Major stress as a child, such as bullying or difficulties with school. Divorce or marriage problems. Relationship problems or trouble getting along with others. Major changes in life, such as retirement, having a baby or moving away. Bad experiences, such as losing a job, loss of a loved one or having money problems. Problems in school or at work. Life-threatening experiences, such as physical assault, combat or natural disaster. Ongoing stressors, such as having a medical illness or living in a neighborhood that has a lot of crime. More than one major change or bad experience happening at the same time. Other mental health conditions, such as major depression, intense anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder.",
        "Complications": "If adjustment disorders do not resolve, they eventually can lead to more-serious mental health conditions such as anxiety, major depression, or misuse of drugs or alcohol.",
        "Prevention": "There are no guaranteed ways to prevent adjustment disorders. But social support, healthy coping skills and learning to recover quickly from hard times may help you during times of high stress. If you know that a stressful situation is coming up, such as a move or retirement, plan ahead. In advance, increase your healthy habits and ask your friends and family for support. Remind yourself that stressful situations pass in time and that you can get through them. Also, consider checking in with your health care team or mental health professional to review healthy ways to manage your stress."

Adrenal glands produce hormones that give instructions to virtually every organ and tissue in your body. Adrenal cancer, also called adrenocortical cancer, can occur at any age. But it's most likely to affect children younger than 5 and adults in their 40s and 50s. When adrenal cancer is found early, there is a chance for cure. But if the cancer has spread to areas beyond the adrenal glands, cure becomes less likely. Treatment can be used to delay progression or recurrence. Most growths that form in the adrenal glands are noncancerous (benign). Benign adrenal tumors, such as adenoma or pheochromocytoma, also can develop in the adrenal glands.",
        "Symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of adrenal cancer include: Weight gain Muscle weakness Pink or purple stretch marks on the skin Hormone changes in women that might cause excess facial hair, hair loss on the head and irregular periods Hormone changes in men that might cause enlarged breast tissue and shrinking testicles Nausea Vomiting Abdominal bloating Back pain Fever Loss of appetite Loss of weight without trying",
        "Causes": "It's not clear what causes adrenal cancer. Adrenal cancer forms when something creates changes (mutations) in the DNA of an adrenal gland cell. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutations can tell the cell to multiply uncontrollably and to continue living when healthy cells would die. When this happens, the abnormal cells accumulate and form a tumor. The tumor cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body.",
        "Risk factors": "Adrenal cancer happens more often in people with inherited syndromes that increase the risk of certain cancers. These inherited syndromes include: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome Carney complex Li-Fraumeni syndrome Lynch syndrome Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1)",

        "Overview": "Adrenoleukodystrophy (uh-dree-noh-loo-koh-DIS-truh-fee) is a type of hereditary (genetic) condition that damages the membrane (myelin sheath) that insulates nerve cells in your brain. In adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), your body can't break down very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), causing saturated VLCFAs to build up in your brain, nervous system and adrenal gland. The most common type of ALD is X-linked ALD, which is caused by a genetic defect on the X chromosome. X-linked ALD affects males more severely than females, who carry the disease. Forms of X-linked ALD include: Childhood-onset ALD. This form of X-linked ALD usually occurs between ages 4 and 10. The white matter of the brain is progressively damaged (leukodystrophy), and symptoms worsen over time. If not diagnosed early, childhood-onset ALD may lead to death within five to 10 years. Addison's disease. Hormone-producing glands (adrenal glands) often fail to produce enough steroids (adrenal insufficiency) in people who have ALD, causing a form of X-linked ALD known as Addison's disease. Adrenomyeloneuropathy. This adult-onset form of X-linked ALD is a less severe and slowly progressive form that causes symptoms such as a stiff gait and bladder and bowel dysfunction.

        "Overview": "Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental health disorder that includes a combination of persistent problems, such as difficulty paying attention, hyperactivity and impulsive behavior. Adult ADHD can lead to unstable relationships, poor work or school performance, low self-esteem, and other problems. Though it's called adult ADHD, symptoms start in early childhood and continue into adulthood. In some cases, ADHD is not recognized or diagnosed until the person is an adult. Adult ADHD symptoms may not be as clear as ADHD symptoms in children. In adults, hyperactivity may decrease, but struggles with impulsiveness, restlessness and difficulty paying attention may continue. Treatment for adult ADHD is similar to treatment for childhood ADHD. Adult ADHD treatment includes medications, psychological counseling (psychotherapy) and treatment for any mental health conditions that occur along with ADHD.",
        "Symptoms": "Some people with ADHD have fewer symptoms as they age, but some adults continue to have major symptoms that interfere with daily functioning. In adults, the main features of ADHD may include difficulty paying attention, impulsiveness and restlessness. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. Many adults with ADHD aren't aware they have it — they just know that everyday tasks can be a challenge. Adults with ADHD may find it difficult to focus and prioritize, leading to missed deadlines and forgotten meetings or social plans. The inability to control impulses can range from impatience waiting in line or driving in traffic to mood swings and outbursts of anger. Adult ADHD symptoms may include: Impulsiveness Disorganization and problems prioritizing Poor time management skills Problems focusing on a task Trouble multitasking Excessive activity or restlessness Poor planning Low frustration tolerance Frequent mood swings Problems following through and completing tasks Hot temper Trouble coping with stress Almost everyone has some symptoms similar to ADHD at some point in their lives. If your difficulties are recent or occurred only occasionally in the past, you probably don't have ADHD. ADHD is diagnosed only when symptoms are severe enough to cause ongoing problems in more than one area of your life. These persistent and disruptive symptoms can be traced back to early childhood. Diagnosis of ADHD in adults can be difficult because certain ADHD symptoms are similar to those caused by other conditions, such as anxiety or mood disorders. And many adults with ADHD also have at least one other mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety. If any of the symptoms listed above continually disrupt your life, talk to your doctor about whether you might have ADHD. Different types of health care professionals may diagnose and supervise treatment for ADHD. Seek a provider who has training and experience in caring for adults with ADHD.",
        "Causes": "While the exact cause of ADHD is not clear, research efforts continue. Factors that may be involved in the development of ADHD include: Genetics. ADHD can run in families, and studies indicate that genes may play a role. Environment. Certain environmental factors also may increase risk, such as lead exposure as a child. Problems during development. Problems with the central nervous system at key moments in development may play a role.",
        "Risk factors": "Risk of ADHD may increase if: You have blood relatives, such as a parent or sibling, with ADHD or another mental health disorder Your mother smoked, drank alcohol or used drugs during pregnancy As a child, you were exposed to environmental toxins — such as lead, found mainly in paint and pipes in older buildings You were born prematurely",
        "Complications": "ADHD can make life difficult for you. ADHD has been linked to: Poor school or work performance Unemployment Financial problems Trouble with the law Alcohol or other substance misuse Frequent car accidents or other accidents Unstable relationships Poor physical and mental health Poor self-image Suicide attempts Although ADHD doesn't cause other psychological or developmental problems, other disorders often occur along with ADHD and make treatment more challenging. These include: Mood disorders. Many adults with ADHD also have depression, bipolar disorder or another mood disorder. While mood problems aren't necessarily due directly to ADHD, a repeated pattern of failures and frustrations due to ADHD can worsen depression. Anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders occur fairly often in adults with ADHD. Anxiety disorders may cause overwhelming worry, nervousness and other symptoms. Anxiety can be made worse by the challenges and setbacks caused by ADHD. Other psychiatric disorders. Adults with ADHD are at increased risk of other psychiatric disorders, such as personality disorders, intermittent explosive disorder and substance use disorders. Learning disabilities.

The condition can occur in some people as a single episode that goes away. In other people, the condition doesn't go away, or it goes away but comes back. Adult Still disease can damage joints, particularly the wrists. Treatment involves medicine to reduce pain and help control the disease. Prednisone is often used if pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) are not enough.",
        "Symptoms": "Most people with adult Still disease have a combination of the following symptoms: Fever. Fever may rise to at least 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius). The fever may spike once or twice a day for a week or longer.  Rash. A rash might come and go with the fever. The rash usually appears on the trunk, arms or legs. Sore throat. This is one of the first symptoms of adult Still disease. The lymph nodes in the neck might be swollen and tender. Achy and swollen joints. Joints — especially in the knees and wrists— might be stiff, painful and inflamed. Ankles, elbows, hands and shoulders also might ache. The joint discomfort usually lasts at least two weeks. Muscle pain. Muscular pain usually comes and goes with the fever. The pain can be severe enough to disrupt daily activities. Symptoms of this disorder can differ from person to person. They can mimic those of other conditions, including lupus and a type of cancer called lymphoma. If you have a high fever, rash and achy joints, see your health care provider. Also, if you have adult Still disease and develop a cough, difficulty breathing, chest pain or any other symptoms that are not usual, call your health care provider.",

        "Complications": "Adult Still disease inflames the organs and joints. Most complications from the disease result from this inflammation. Joint destruction. The chronic swelling and irritation that occurs with adult Still disease can damage the joints. The most commonly involved joints are the knees and wrists. Sometimes other joints, including the neck, foot, finger and hip joints, also are affected. Inflammation of the heart. Adult Still disease can inflame the saclike covering of the heart, called the pericardium. This results in inflammation of the pericardium, called pericarditis. The disease can also inflame the muscular part of the heart, called the myocardium. This results in inflammation of the myocardium, called myocarditis. Excess fluid around the lungs. Inflammation may cause fluid to build up around the lungs. When this happens, it can be hard to take deep breaths. Macrophage activation syndrome.

        "Causes": "Age spots are caused by overactive pigment cells. Ultraviolet (UV) light speeds up the production of melanin, a natural pigment that gives skin its color. On skin that has had years of sun exposure, age spots appear when melanin becomes clumped or is produced in high concentrations. Use of commercial tanning lamps and beds also can cause age spots.",

        "Prevention": "To help avoid age spots and new spots after treatment, follow these tips for limiting your sun exposure: Avoid the sun between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Because the sun's rays are most intense during this time, try to schedule outdoor activities for other times of the day. Use sunscreen. Fifteen to 30 minutes before going outdoors, apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or perspiring. Cover up. For protection from the sun, wear tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs and a broad-brimmed hat, which provides more protection than does a baseball cap or golf visor. Consider wearing clothing designed to provide sun protection. Look for clothes labeled with an ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) of 40 to 50 to get the best protection."

    "Agoraphobia": {
        "Overview": "Agoraphobia (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder. Agoraphobia involves fearing and avoiding places or situations that might cause panic and feelings of being trapped, helpless or embarrassed. You may fear an actual or upcoming situation. For example, you may fear using public transportation, being in open or enclosed spaces, standing in line, or being in a crowd. The anxiety is caused by fear that there's no easy way to escape or get help if the anxiety gets overwhelming. You may avoid situations because of fears such as getting lost, falling, or having diarrhea and not being able to get to a bathroom. Most people who have agoraphobia develop it after having one or more panic attacks, causing them to worry about having another attack. They then avoid the places where it may happen again. Agoraphobia often results in having a hard time feeling safe in any public place, especially where crowds gather and in locations that are not familiar. You may feel that you need a companion, such as a family member or friend, to go with you to public places. The fear can be so overwhelming that you may feel you can't leave your home. Agoraphobia treatment can be challenging because it means confronting your fears. But with proper treatment — usually a form of therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy and medicines — you can escape the trap of agoraphobia and live a more enjoyable life.",
        "Symptoms": "Typical agoraphobia symptoms include fear of: Leaving home alone. Crowds or waiting in line. Enclosed spaces, such as movie theaters, elevators or small stores. Open spaces, such as parking lots, bridges or malls. Using public transportation, such as a bus, plane or train. These situations cause anxiety because you fear you won't be able to escape or find help if you start to feel panicked. Or you may fear having other disabling or embarrassing symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting, falling or diarrhea. In addition: Your fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger of the situation. You avoid the situation, you need a companion to go with you, or you endure the situation but are extremely upset. You have major distress or problems with social situations, work or other areas in your life because of the fear, anxiety or avoidance. Your fear and avoidance usually lasts six months or longer. Some people have panic disorder in addition to agoraphobia. Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder that includes panic attacks. A panic attack is a sudden feeling of extreme fear that reaches a peak within a few minutes and triggers a variety of intense physical symptoms. You might think that you're totally losing control, having a heart attack or even dying. Fear of another panic attack can lead to avoiding similar situations or the place where it happened in an attempt to prevent future panic attacks. Symptoms of a panic attack can include: Rapid heart rate. Trouble breathing or a feeling of choking. Chest pain or pressure. Lightheadedness or dizziness. Feeling shaky, numb or tingling. Sweating too much. Sudden flushing or chills. Upset stomach or diarrhea. Feeling a loss of control. Fear of dying. Agoraphobia can severely limit your ability to socialize, work, attend important events and even manage the details of daily life, such as running errands. Don't let agoraphobia make your world smaller. Call your health care provider or a mental health professional if you have symptoms of agoraphobia or panic attacks.",
        "Causes": "Biology — including health conditions and genetics — personality, stress and learning experiences may all play a role in the development of agoraphobia.",
        "Risk factors": "Agoraphobia can begin in childhood, but usually starts in the late teen or early adult years — usually before age 35. But older adults also can develop it. Females are diagnosed with agoraphobia more often than males are. Risk factors for agoraphobia include: Having panic disorder or other excessive fear reactions, called phobias. Responding to panic attacks with too much fear and avoidance. Experiencing stressful life events, such as abuse, the death of a parent or being attacked. Having an anxious or nervous personality. Having a blood relative with agoraphobia.",
        "Complications": "Agoraphobia can greatly limit your life's activities. If your agoraphobia is severe, you may not even be able to leave your home. Without treatment, some people become housebound for years. If this happens to you, you may not be able to visit with family and friends, go to school or work, run errands, or take part in other routine daily activities. You may become dependent on others for help. Agoraphobia also can lead to: Depression. Alcohol or drug misuse. Suicidal thoughts and behavior.",
        "Prevention": "There's no sure way to prevent agoraphobia. But anxiety tends to increase the more you avoid situations that you fear. If you start to have mild fears about going places that are safe, try to practice going to those places over and over again. This can help you feel more comfortable in those places. If this is too hard to do on your own, ask a family member or friend to go with you, or seek professional help. If you experience anxiety going places or have panic attacks, get treatment as soon as possible. Get help early to keep symptoms from getting worse. Anxiety, like many other mental health conditions, can be harder to treat if you wait."

    "Airplane ear": {
        "Overview": "Airplane ear (ear barotrauma) is the stress on your eardrum that occurs when the air pressure in your middle ear and the air pressure in the environment are out of balance. You might get airplane ear when on an airplane that's climbing after takeoff or descending for landing. Airplane ear is also called ear barotrauma, barotitis media or aerotitis media. Self-care steps — such as yawning, swallowing or chewing gum — usually can counter the differences in air pressure and improve airplane ear symptoms. However, for a severe case of airplane ear, you might need to see a doctor.",
        "Symptoms": "Airplane ear can occur in one or both ears. Common signs and symptoms include: Moderate discomfort or pain in your ear Feeling of fullness or stuffiness in your ear Muffled hearing or slight to moderate hearing loss If airplane ear is severe, you might have: Severe pain Increased ear pressure Moderate to severe hearing loss Ringing in your ear (tinnitus) Spinning sensation (vertigo) Bleeding from your ear",
        "Causes": "Airplane ear occurs when the air pressure in the middle ear and the air pressure in the environment don't match, preventing your eardrum (tympanic membrane) from vibrating normally. A narrow passage called the eustachian tube, which is connected to the middle ear, regulates air pressure.",
        "Risk factors": "Any condition that blocks the eustachian tube or limits its function can increase the risk of airplane ear. Common risk factors include: A small eustachian tube, especially in infants and toddlers The common cold Sinus infection Hay fever (allergic rhinitis) Middle ear infection (otitis media) Sleeping on an airplane during ascent and descent because you aren't actively doing things to equalize pressure in your ears such as yawning or swallowing",
        "Complications": "Airplane ear usually isn't serious and responds to self-care. Long-term complications can rarely occur when the condition is serious or prolonged or if there's damage to middle or inner ear structures. Rare complications may include: Permanent hearing loss Ongoing (chronic) tinnitus",
        "Prevention": "Follow these tips to avoid airplane ear: Yawn and swallow during ascent and descent. These activate the muscles that open your eustachian tubes. You can suck on candy or chew gum to help you swallow. Use the Valsalva maneuver during ascent and descent. Gently blow, as if blowing your nose, while pinching your nostrils and keeping your mouth closed. Repeat several times, especially during descent, to equalize the pressure between your ears and the airplane cabin. Don't sleep during takeoffs and landings. If you're awake during ascents and descents, you can do the necessary self-care techniques when you feel pressure in your ears. Reconsider travel plans. If possible, don't fly when you have a cold, a sinus infection, nasal congestion or an ear infection. If you've recently had ear surgery, talk to your doctor about when it's safe to travel. Use an over-the-counter nasal spray. If you have nasal congestion, use a nasal spray about 30 minutes to an hour before takeoff and landing. Avoid overuse, however, because nasal sprays taken over three to four days can increase congestion. Use decongestant pills cautiously. Decongestants taken by mouth might help if taken 30 minutes to an hour before an airplane flight. However, if you have heart disease, a heart rhythm disorder or high blood pressure or you're pregnant, avoid taking an oral decongestant. Take allergy medication. If you have allergies, take your medication about an hour before your flight. Try filtered earplugs. These earplugs slowly equalize the pressure against your eardrum during ascents and descents. You can purchase these at drugstores, airport gift shops or a hearing clinic. However, you'll still need to yawn and swallow to relieve pressure. If you're prone to severe airplane ear and must fly often or if you're having hyperbaric oxygen therapy to heal wounds, your doctor might surgically place tubes in your eardrums to aid fluid drainage, ventilate your middle ear, and equalize the pressure between your outer ear and middle ear."

    "Albinism": {
        "Overview": "The term albinism usually refers to oculocutaneous (ok-u-low-ku-TAY-nee-us) albinism (OCA). OCA is a group of disorders passed down in families where the body makes little or none of a substance called melanin. The type and amount of melanin in your body determines the color of your skin, hair and eyes. Melanin also plays a role in the development and function of the eyes, so people with albinism have vision problems. Symptoms of albinism are usually seen in a person's skin, hair and eye color, but sometimes differences are slight. People with albinism are also sensitive to the effects of the sun, so they're at higher risk of getting skin cancer. Although there's no cure for albinism, people with the disorder can take steps to protect their skin and eyes and get proper eye and skin care.",
        "Symptoms": "Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision. The easiest form of albinism to see results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings or other blood relatives. But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown. People of African descent who have albinism may have skin that is light brown or red brown and have freckles. For some people, skin color may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism. With exposure to the sun, some people may develop: Freckles. Moles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink. Large freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez). Sunburn and no ability to tan. For some people with albinism, skin coloring never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in color. Hair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, red or brown. Hair color also may darken by early adulthood. Or hair may stain from contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker with age. Eyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age. With albinism, the colored parts of the eyes, called the irises, usually don't have enough pigment. This allows light to shine through the irises and makes the eyes extremely sensitive to bright light. Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting. Vision problems are a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems may include: Rapid, back-and-forth movement of the eyes that can't be controlled, called nystagmus. An uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better. Eyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus. Problems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness. Extreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia. A difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision. Differences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference results in reduced vision. Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve. Poor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is. Legal blindness — vision less than 20/200 — or complete blindness. At your child's birth, the health care provider may notice a lack of color in hair or skin that affects the eyelashes and eyebrows. The provider will likely order an eye exam and closely follow any changes in your child's skin color and vision. If you observe signs of albinism in your baby, talk to your health care provider. Contact your health care provider if your child with albinism experiences frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising or long-term infections. These symptoms may suggest rare but serious hereditary conditions that include albinism.",
        "Causes": "Several genes give instructions for making one of several proteins involved in producing melanin. Melanin is made by cells called melanocytes that are found in your skin, hair and eyes. Albinism is caused by a change in one of these genes. Different types of albinism can occur, based mainly on which gene change caused the disorder. The gene change may result in no melanin at all or a big decrease in the amount of melanin. Types of albinism are grouped based on how they're passed down in families and on the gene that is affected. Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), the most common type, means a person gets two copies of a changed gene — one from each parent. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance. OCA is the result of a change in one of eight genes, labeled from OCA1 to OCA8. OCA causes decreased pigment in the skin, hair and eyes, as well as vision problems. The amount of pigment varies by type. The resulting color of skin, hair and eyes also varies by and within types. Ocular albinism is mainly limited to the eyes, causing vision problems. The most common form of ocular albinism is type 1. This type is passed down by a gene change on the X chromosome. X-linked ocular albinism can be passed on by a mother who carries one changed X gene to her son. This is called X-linked recessive inheritance. Ocular albinism usually occurs only in males. It's much less common than OCA. Albinism related to rare hereditary syndromes can occur. For example, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as bleeding and bruising problems and lung and bowel diseases. Chediak-Higashi syndrome includes a form of OCA, as well as immune problems with recurrent infections, problems with the brain and nerves, bleeding disorders, and other serious issues.",
        "Risk factors": "Risk factors depend on whether one or both parents carry an affected gene. Different types of albinism have different types of inheritance patterns.",
        "Complications": "Albinism can include skin and eye complications. It also can include social and emotional challenges. Problems with vision can impact learning, employment and the ability to drive. People with albinism have skin that is very sensitive to light and sun. Sunburn is one of the most serious complications of albinism. Sun exposure can cause sun damage, which may result in rough and thickened skin. Sunburn also can increase the risk of developing skin cancer. Because of the lack of skin pigment, a type of skin cancer called melanoma may appear as pink or red growths or moles, rather than the usual black or brown color. This can make skin cancer harder to identify at an early stage. Without careful and regular skin exams, melanoma may not be diagnosed until it's advanced. Some people with albinism may experience discrimination. The reactions of other people to those with albinism can have a negative impact on people with the condition. People with albinism may experience bullying, teasing or unwanted questions about their appearance, eyewear or visual aid tools. They may look different from members of their own families or ethnic groups, so they may feel like outsiders or be treated like outsiders. These experiences may cause social isolation, poor self-esteem and stress. Using the term \"person with albinism\" is preferred to avoid the negative impact of other terms.",
        "Prevention": "If a family member has albinism, a genetic counselor can help you understand the type of albinism and the chances of having a future child with albinism. The counselor can explain the available genetic tests."
